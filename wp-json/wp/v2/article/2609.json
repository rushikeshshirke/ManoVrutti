There is no gray area\u2014just the extremes. It has to be perfect or else you\u2019re a failure. Example: \u201cI\u2019m always a horrible mother.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m never going to get it together.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Overgeneralization:<\/strong> Taking a single event and making sweeping conclusions. Example: \u201cMy best friend is mad at me. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t want to be friends ever again.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Negative mental filter:<\/strong> You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it, ignoring all the positive or neutral things that might have happened. Example: \u201cIt was such an important meeting. Why did I make that stupid statement? I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Discounting the positive:<\/strong> You ignore when good things happen by insisting they \u201cdon\u2019t count\u201d because there were other circumstances. This allows your brain to stay in a pattern of negative thinking. Example: \u201cNo one will ever love me.\u201d \u201cWe love you.\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. No one will ever love me.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Jumping to conclusions:<\/strong> You assume that something bad will happen or that someone will have negative feelings toward you, even though you don\u2019t have any evidence to support that thought. Example: \u201cMy boss must be mad at me for being late. I\u2019m not going to bother talking to him because he won\u2019t believe my excuse.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mind reading:<\/strong> You assign negative thoughts and feelings to other people, even when there are other logical explanations for what happened. Example: \u201cMy neighbor rushed by me and didn\u2019t even acknowledge me. I must have done something wrong.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fortune Telling:<\/strong> You assume that things are going to turn out badly and treat negative outcomes as eventualities, not possibilities. Example: \u201cI submitted my application, but I already know they won\u2019t call me back for an interview.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Catastrophizing<\/strong> is when you exaggerate the importance of things that you do (like making a mistake at work) or that someone else does (that someone got a better office than you). Example: \u201cWhy did I use that word in that email? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to get fired.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Minimizing<\/strong> is the opposite; it\u2019s when you discount the importance of something that\u2019s actually really important. Example: \u201cYeah I got a raise, but it\u2019s not big deal. I\u2019m not even sure why they gave it to me.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Emotional reasoning:<\/strong> You assume that just because you felt something, it\u2019s true; it\u2019s like relying too strongly on<br \/>\nyour gut instinct. Example: \u201cI feel like crap, so I\u2019m probably a crappy person.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Should statements:<\/strong> You focus on how things should have gone or should have been rather than how they actually are. When you direct &#8220;should statements&#8221; toward others, you can feel anger, frustration, and resentment. Examples: \u201cI should really exercise more. I\u2019m so gross.\u201d or \u201cMy brother should have talked to me before he made any decisions about where our family is going. He\u2019s so inconsiderate.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Labeling:<\/strong> This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. You take a situation (a one-time event, misunderstanding or accident) and you determine it must be about your character or their character. Examples: \u201cThey didn\u2019t like me: I\u2019m a huge nobody.\u201d or \u201cThat guy cut me off. He\u2019s obviously a jerk.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Personalization:<\/strong> You take on responsibility for negative events, ignoring how other people or factors may have contributed. Example: \u201cOur relationship ended because I was a bad partner.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blaming:<\/strong> The opposite of personalization. You lay blame entirely on other people, without thinking about where you may have gone wrong or how you could have changed a situation. Example: \u201cOur project is slowed down because they never made a point to contact me. This is all their fault.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Worksheet to help you understand where negative thoughts come from\u2014and what to do about
