Were you with certain people, doing a certain activity, or in a certain location?<\/li>\n<li>What are some things you are proud of yourself for doing in the past to create a stronger sense of belonging?<\/li>\n<li>Are there friends, loved ones, or pets in your life who make you feel understood? What makes those relationships feel good?<\/li>\n<li>Connection looks different for everybody. What are some experiences or groups that made you feel like you belonged?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Exploring new connections<\/h2>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Comparing your social life to others\u2019 can make you feel more alone or insecure. Let\u2019s try looking at this with a different lens. Regardless of what you see in others\u2019 lives, what kind of social life do you want?<\/li>\n<li>What makes a quality friendship?<\/li>\n<li>How would you like to spend your time?<\/li>\n<li>When you look at your thoughts around feeling connected, do you notice any patterns? What are they?<\/li>\n<li>Are there opportunities to get connected, like a program at your school that you can get involved with?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Setting goals<\/h2>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Think about how you described connection in the section above. Based on that, what is <strong>one goal<\/strong> you can set to make your social life feel better?<\/li>\n<li>What are <strong>three steps<\/strong> you can take to meet that goal?<\/li>\n<li>Picture yourself in a year. What would future you look back and be proud of you for doing to create a stronger sense of belonging?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It can be hard to know if your insecurities or troubles with friends are just a part of growing up or if they&#8217;re signs of a mental health condition, like anxiety or depression.
