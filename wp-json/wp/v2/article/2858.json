While some people experience no side effects, the more common side effects like sexual dysfunction, weight gain, tremors, and drowsiness can make getting through the day really challenging and sometimes miserable.<\/p>\n<p>In the same way that you would weigh the risks and benefits of a medical procedure, you should weigh the pros and cons of your medication. If the side effects are frustrating but the medication has seriously improved your life, you might consider continuing to take it and discussing your concerns with your doctor. It may be worth living with. Some people end up taking other medications to deal with the side effects of a medication that is working for them.<\/p>\n<p>There is also the option of trying different types of medications in the same category. For example, if you\u2019re having unpleasant side effects from an antidepressant you were prescribed, you might work with your doctor to try a different antidepressant. This can be a frustrating and potentially long process, but you could end up with a medication that works for you with little to no side effects.<\/p>\n<p>You may also decide that you do not want to take medication at all because of the side effects. This is an option some people choose, too. If you feel this is something you want or if you want to make any changes to your medications, make sure you work with your prescribing doctor. It is dangerous to suddenly stop or change your medication without the help of a professional.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All medications and medical treatments have potential side effects, and psych medications are no different.
