Life\u2019s hard enough when you only have to worry about yourself! To some extent, caregiving is always going to be tough\u2014but there are a few things you can do to help manage that stress.<\/p>\n<h2>Acknowledge your feelings about caregiving<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re taking care of someone else, a lot of the focus is on the other person: What do <em>they<\/em> need? How do <em>they<\/em> feel? You might feel like it\u2019s your job to sacrifice your own happiness to take care of them. It might seem a little selfish to think about your own feelings. But no matter how hard you try, you\u2019re still a person, and people feel a lot of emotions. Caregiving can bring up some really tough ones. You might feel:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exhausted<\/li>\n<li>Stressed<\/li>\n<li>Resentful<\/li>\n<li>Isolated and alone<\/li>\n<li>Hopeless<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you ignore your feelings about caregiving, they won\u2019t go away\u2014they\u2019ll just get bottled up. Sooner or later, they\u2019ll come out. You might snap at someone, or stress can slowly build up and make you sick. That\u2019s not good for <em>you<\/em>, but it also makes it even harder to take care of someone else\u2014so <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-find-support-caregiver\/\">there\u2019s really nothing selfish about taking care of yourself<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It might help to write down your feelings, or find a friend or family member who\u2019s willing to listen as you talk through them. Support groups for caregivers, either in-person or online, can be really helpful too. Make sure you find time for yourself. Take breaks when you can. Make sure you\u2019re doing things you enjoy, and spending time with other people you care about.<\/p>\n<h2>Manage expectations<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to define your role as a caregiver in terms of what the other person needs or wants. After all, they can\u2019t meet their needs on their own, so it\u2019s your job to do it\u2014right?<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you\u2019re just one person. There\u2019s only so much one person can do. Even if you could dedicate all your time and energy to caregiving (and you probably can\u2019t), you still couldn\u2019t make life perfect for the person you\u2019re taking care of. Be realistic about what you\u2019re capable of.<\/p>\n<h2>Ask for help<\/h2>\n<p>You might feel like you\u2019re the only one in the world who can help. Not only is that really stressful, it\u2019s also probably not entirely true. Finding ways to share the load, even just a little, can make a big difference.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe another family member can take over for a few hours so you can take a nap or go do something you enjoy. Maybe a friend can help entertain the person for a little while. Maybe there\u2019s a local organization where you can ask for volunteers to help you out. You can also look for more formal services, such as <strong>respite care<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-help-someone-make-decisions-about-their-mental-health\/\">Involve the person you\u2019re taking care of in these decisions, too<\/a>. Ask them what they need and want from you. Maybe there\u2019s something you\u2019ve been doing that they actually could manage for themselves. Depending on your relationship with them, it might be appropriate to let them know how you\u2019re feeling. You might also talk about how they can express their needs in a way that makes you feel more appreciated and less overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<h2>Setting boundaries<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes asking for help doesn\u2019t go as well as you\u2019d hoped. Maybe the person you\u2019re taking care of has unreasonable expectations of you. Maybe you have other family members who could help, but have dumped the responsibility on you.<\/p>\n<p>You may have to have some difficult conversations about what you\u2019re willing and able to do. It might help to write out your thoughts or talk through them with someone else first. Once you set boundaries, stick to them. It\u2019s okay to be firm\u2014people often struggle with new boundaries at first, but in time they\u2019ll adjust, and you\u2019ll have a much better experience as a caregiver if you communicate clearly with the people around you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taking care of another person\u2014whether it\u2019s a friend, family member, or significant other\u2014is stressful.
