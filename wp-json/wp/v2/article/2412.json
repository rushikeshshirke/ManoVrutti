They can sit down and have one glass of wine with dinner, two beers at a picnic, or a cocktail at happy hour and then head home.<\/p>\n<p>And then some of us have issues with what we call impulse control\u2014meaning we can\u2019t always stop even when we want to.<\/p>\n<p>There are many reasons that you can\u2019t stop drinking after three beers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even though alcohol is technically a depressant, the part that relaxes your inhibitions can make you a little wild and hyper. It makes it easier and easier to make decisions that you wouldn\u2019t make sober (like having that fourth or fifth drink, taking that shot, or getting behind the wheel of a car.) If this is happening every once in a while, like on your birthday or a holiday, that may not be a big deal (although you should\u00a0<strong>never, ever<\/strong>\u00a0drive after drinking.) If it happens to you regularly, there may be something else going on.<\/li>\n<li>Maybe you have an underlying mental health problem, like generalized or social anxiety, and you use alcohol to take the \u201cedge\u201d off or to function with groups of people. We often refer to this as self-medicating. It\u2019s a risky behavior for a number of reasons, especially if you find yourself drinking a lot as a result.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s possible you have a really hard time with your impulse control. If this is you, you might see that manifest in other ways, like playing video games obsessively or stressing out if you can\u2019t get on Facebook.<\/li>\n<li>This behavior may be a sign that you have an addiction to alcohol or that you are a problem drinker.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless of the reason, if being unable to cut back is bothering you\u2014or someone you care about and trust has mentioned it\u2014you should talk to a professional. A great place to start is your primary care physician who you see every day. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with a medical doctor, there are therapists or counselors who specialize in alcohol or substance use.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some people are really good at drinking in moderation.
