It is not a forum. It is a live chat; there is no video or audio. Everyone is chatting during the same time. It\u2019s safer, because there is always a facilitator present, someone who works at an LGBTQ+ center.<\/p>\n<p>When you join a Q Chat Space discussion, a facilitator will greet you. There will be some time to informally meet others who are joining the discussion. After introductions and a review of group agreements, there will be open discussion on a designated topic and sometimes it is just open discussion. You are free to share as much or as little as you like. Check it out and see the schedule for upcoming groups here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qchatspace.org\/\">https:\/\/www.qchatspace.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What people say about it<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people say that talking online is really impersonal and stuff but I feel so much love radiating from my computer screen<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I feel pretty good since I got to talk to you guys<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I love it!!
