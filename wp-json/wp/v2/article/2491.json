It might feel like they don\u2019t trust you. It might feel like they don\u2019t need your help\u2014and it\u2019s nice to feel needed. You might also simply feel confused, especially if they used to talk to you more.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also just hard to watch someone suffer and not know how to help. What can you do for someone who won\u2019t talk to you about their mental health?<\/p>\n<h2>Understanding why they won\u2019t open up<\/h2>\n<p>There are lots of reasons why someone might be hesitant to open up to you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maybe they don\u2019t know what to say.<\/strong> Talking about mental health is hard. They might not fully understand what they\u2019re experiencing themselves, let alone how to describe it to someone else.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maybe they feel ashamed.<\/strong> We\u2019ve come a long way in normalizing mental illness, but there\u2019s still a stigma attached to it. Don\u2019t talk down to them or imply that their mental illness makes them less capable or mature. You can set an example by talking about your own mental health.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They don\u2019t want to scare you.<\/strong> They might be having dark suicidal thoughts. They might be harming themselves. As long as they don\u2019t have a plan to commit suicide, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re in immediate danger\u2014but it might scare you to hear what they\u2019re thinking or doing. Sometimes people living with mental illness develop a dark sense of humor as a coping skill. They may use your reaction to their jokes as a way to determine whether or not you\u2019ll understand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They could be keeping secrets.<\/strong> Maybe they were mistreated, physically or emotionally. Maybe the person who mistreated them was a family member or someone close to you, and they\u2019re afraid of how you will react. Will you believe them? Will you be heartbroken? Whose side will you take? They could be trying to protect you\u2014or to protect the person who hurt them, or themselves.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maybe it has something to do with you.<\/strong> Mental health has a lot to do with relationships. Their mental health might be affecting their relationship with you, or vice versa.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can they trust you? <\/strong>When they\u2019ve told you sensitive information in the past, how have you handled it? Did you get defensive? Did you really listen, or did you just try to give them advice? Did you blame them, or minimize the pain they\u2019re feeling? Did you make it all about you? Did you pass on private information to someone else? You may need to take a hard, honest look at yourself and see if there\u2019s something you can do to be seen as more trustworthy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maybe they just don\u2019t want to.<\/strong> At the end of the day, they don\u2019t owe you an explanation. There doesn\u2019t have to be a reason\u2014it\u2019s their right to decide what to share with you and what not to. It might break your heart, but it\u2019s important to respect their boundaries and not press the issue too much.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, if they\u2019re not telling you about their mental health, they\u2019re probably also not telling you <em>why<\/em>. That\u2019s okay. Just try to put yourself in their shoes and consider the reasons why they might not feel comfortable talking right now.<\/p>\n<h2>So what can I do?<\/h2>\n<p>Take a second to think about what your goal is. Are you trying to do what\u2019s best for them? Or are you trying to <em>make<\/em> them open up so that you feel more in control? It\u2019s certainly a lot easier to help someone when they\u2019re willing to tell you what they need\u2014but <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-help-loved-one-mental-illness\/\">there are still other ways to help<\/a> in the meantime.<\/p>\n<p>Respect their decision to not open up to you. Tell them that you understand how hard it is to talk about mental health. Let them know you\u2019re there for them when they\u2019re ready to talk.<\/p>\n<p>Understand that they may <em>never<\/em> be ready to talk to you about it. Don\u2019t take it personally\u2014just find other ways to support them. Spend quality time with them. Have fun together. Watch a TV show together, or grab something to eat. Support their treatment any way you can. Offer to take them to an appointment with their therapist or doctor\u2014especially if it\u2019s their first time.<\/p>\n<p>If and when they do open up, don\u2019t jump at the chance to give advice or tell them how <em>you<\/em> feel. Just listen. Reflect back what you\u2019re hearing and ask questions to make sure you understand. If they do ask you for advice, make it clear that you\u2019re sharing your own perspective\u2014don\u2019t act like you know best, or that your solution is the only way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It hurts when someone you care about won\u2019t open up to you.
