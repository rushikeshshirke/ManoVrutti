Sometimes people go specifically because of what the hospital has to offer. Other times, it\u2019s just the first place we think of when we are in crisis. Understanding what happens when you check yourself into a hospital can help you decide whether it\u2019s the best option for you right now.<\/p>\n<h2>How can the hospital help with\u00a0mental illness?<\/h2>\n<p>There are lots of reasons why people go to the hospital for mental illness. Here are a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To be monitored.<\/strong> Sometimes people experiencing mental illness feel like they can\u2019t trust themselves. Maybe you can\u2019t seem to stop hurting yourself or you are afraid you might hurt someone else. In a hospital, you are constantly being monitored by people who are trained to keep you and those around you safe.<\/li>\n<li><strong>To escape for a few days.<\/strong> Hospital stays for mental health are usually pretty short (from a few days to a week or two). But if your day-to-day life is stressing you out, a short break can go a long way for your mental health. While you\u2019re at the hospital, meals are prepared for you, your laundry is done for you, and your meds are given to you by nurses at scheduled times. You don\u2019t have to worry about any of that. It leaves time for you to think about what you\u2019ll do once you\u2019re back in the real world\u2026 or, you can just take that time to watch TV and lay in bed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>To get quick, comprehensive medical care.<\/strong> Meeting all your mental health needs can feel like juggling way too many things at once. There\u2019s medication, therapy, lifestyle changes\u2026 not to mention your physical health. In a hospital, you can see specialists for all of those things\u2014all in a single day! In the real world, scheduling appointments can be a hassle, and sometimes you need to wait to be seen. But in a hospital setting, you can get it all taken care of at once.<\/li>\n<li><strong>To set up aftercare. <\/strong>What happens when your hospital stay is done? Well, answering that question is actually <em>part<\/em> of your stay. If you need medications, you\u2019ll be given refills and possibly even coupons to help you keep up with your meds once you\u2019re on your own. The hospital can make referrals for a pharmacy, a therapist, and any other specialists you might need to see. Often the hospital can help pay for follow-up appointments, if you don\u2019t have insurance that covers them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What other options do I have?<\/h2>\n<p>A hospital stay can be helpful in many situations, but it also has its drawbacks. It\u2019s not the best long-term solution\u2014you probably won&#8217;t walk away from the hospital completely cured. But it can be a great first step.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, a hospital stay can also be expensive. Fortunately, there are ways to get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/managing-high-medical-bills-32221-2.html\">financial assistance<\/a>, so you shouldn\u2019t let this prevent you from keeping yourself safe if it\u2019s your best option.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you decide to go to the hospital or not, it\u2019s important to know that you have lots of options. If you\u2019re in crisis, you can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"http:\/\/988lifeline.org\/chat\">988lifeline.org\/chat<\/a>. You can also <a href=\"sms:+1-741-741;?&amp;body=MHA\">text &#8220;MHA&#8221; to 741-741<\/a> to reach the Crisis Text Line. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/need-talk-someone-warmlines\/\">Warmlines<\/a> are an excellent place for non-crisis support.<\/p>\n<p>For a longer-term solution, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-therapist\/\">schedule an appointment with a therapist<\/a> or talk to your doctor about trying a medication. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/support-groups\/\">Joining a support group can be helpful<\/a>. You can also <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-improve-my-mental-health-on-my-own\/\">improve your mental health on your own<\/a> by learning more about mental illness, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/should-i-tell-someone-i-have-a-mental-illness\/\">opening up to someone you trust<\/a>, and making lifestyle changes.<\/p>\n<h2>Who decides whether or not I\u2019ll go to the hospital?<\/h2>\n<p>In most cases, you\u2019ll need to make that decision for yourself. The laws vary by state, but usually you can only be hospitalized against your will if you present a \u201cclear and present\u201d danger to yourself or others. In other words, it has to seem like you\u2019re really going to hurt someone if you aren\u2019t hospitalized. If that <em>is<\/em> the case, you might be checked into the hospital by a friend or family member, or a mental health professional like a therapist or doctor. But more likely, if one of those people is worried about you, they will try to convince you to check yourself in voluntarily.<\/p>\n<p>In some circumstances, you may want to consider creating a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-a-psychiatric-advance-directive-pad\/\">Psychiatric Advance Directive (PAD)<\/a> before going to the hospital. This is a written legal document that expresses your wishes about what types of treatments, services, and other assistance you do or don&#8217;t want. You prepare your PAD ahead of time. When you&#8217;re having difficulty communicating or making decisions yourself, your loved ones and health care providers can refer back to it. You can also specify which facility you\u2019d prefer to be taken to.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s common for people to go to the hospital because of a mental illness.
