There\u2019s also therapy, lifestyle changes, and alternative treatments like herbal supplements. Each of these has their own pros and cons\u2014there\u2019s no one treatment option that\u2019s right for everyone. Many people need to use multiple options together.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-think-my-medication-is-making-me-feel-worse\/\">Some people have had bad experiences with medication<\/a>, or have heard things about medication that make them nervous. But there are also some really good reasons to be open to trying meds. Let\u2019s explore some of the pros and cons of taking mental health meds, by comparing them to other treatment options.<\/p>\n<h2>Medication vs. doing nothing<\/h2>\n<p>Your first option is to do nothing. You won\u2019t experience side-effects\u2026 but <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/does-mental-illness-go-away-its-own\/\">your mental illness probably won\u2019t get better just by waiting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Medication vs. therapy<\/h2>\n<p>Medications can only help you as long as you are taking them. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-to-expect\/\">Therapy actually teaches you to think and act differently<\/a>, so its effects can last for a long time, even after you\u2019ve stopped going. (Some people continue to see a therapist throughout their lives, and that can be really beneficial too!)<\/p>\n<p>Getting the full benefit of therapy can take a while. You might feel better after your first session, but it can take a long time to really dig deep into what\u2019s going on. In the meantime, medications can help you find more immediate relief. Most of them don\u2019t work instantly\u2026 but if you find one that works for you, you\u2019ll probably feel the benefits within a few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of people get the most benefit from combining medications <em>and <\/em>therapy. They work in different ways and target different <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-causes-mental-illness\/\">causes of mental illness<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Medication vs. lifestyle changes<\/h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-improve-my-mental-health-on-my-own\/\">lots of things you can do on your own to improve your mental health<\/a>. Eating healthier, exercising, journaling, and developing coping skills are all helpful. There are now <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-an-app-help-my-mental-health-problems\/\">apps that can help you manage your mental health<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<p>Lifestyle changes are an important part of everyone\u2019s mental health. For some people, that\u2019s all they need. Those people are very fortunate\u2014they may have strong support systems, less severe symptoms, or brains that are wired differently. Everyone experiences mental illness differently, and each person has different treatment needs. Comparing your recovery to someone else\u2019s is an easy way to feel inadequate. Instead, focus on what works for <em>you<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>Medication vs. herbal supplements<\/h2>\n<p>Medications are made in a lab. They have weird names that are hard to pronounce. They were all discovered or invented pretty recently. You might figure it\u2019s safer to take something that comes from a plant and has been used for thousands of years.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe\u2014or maybe not. Making something in a lab might seem \u201cunnatural,\u201d but medications also have to go through a really long and thorough review process to make sure they\u2019re safe for most people. Drug companies are required to provide clear information about any side-effects you might experience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/consumers\/consumer-updates\/fda-101-dietary-supplements\">Herbal supplements don\u2019t go through this same process<\/a>. Companies that sell supplements <em>do<\/em> have to give you accurate information about what\u2019s in the bottle, but they <em>don\u2019t<\/em> have to prove that the product is safe or effective. Some herbal supplements have been tested for mental health issues, but not as rigorously as medications are. Many haven\u2019t been tested at all.<\/p>\n<p>Not everything that\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d is safe or good for you. Some plants can make you feel better, but others can make you sick. Herbal supplements aren\u2019t bad\u2014they just have their own pros and cons, just like medications do. If you\u2019re going to take herbal supplements, you should treat them just like you would medications: do your research, watch out for side-effects, and talk to your doctor to make sure what you\u2019re taking is safe.<\/p>\n<h2>If I take meds now, will I be on them forever?<\/h2>\n<p>Some people do need to take medications for their whole lives. Other people use medication early on to kick-start their recovery, then stop taking them as they start to see results from therapy and lifestyle changes.<\/p>\n<p>You can develop a <strong>tolerance<\/strong> to a medication, meaning that you need to take more of it to get the same effect. And you can experience <strong>withdrawals<\/strong> if you stop taking it. That might sound scary, but it\u2019s not the same as <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-addiction\/\">being addicted to something<\/a>. If you get to a point where the side-effects outweigh the benefits, your doctor can help you gradually stop taking medications and find the best alternatives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Medications are just one of many treatment options for mental illness.
