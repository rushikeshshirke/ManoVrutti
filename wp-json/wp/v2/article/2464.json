What happens when you can\u2019t go out to meet with those supports in person? Being alone and isolated can be a huge trigger for people in recovery.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-stop-drinking\/\">The basics of staying free from drugs and alcohol<\/a> are the same: learn your triggers, deal with any other mental health concerns you may have, and manage any withdrawal symptoms you might be going through. But there are a few things to keep in mind while you\u2019re stuck at home.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep your days structured<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re working from home, it can be hard to keep your time structured. If you\u2019re not working, it\u2019s even harder! Too much free time can give you lots of time to dwell on negative thoughts or think of excuses to relapse.<\/p>\n<p>Try to establish a routine. As much as possible, wake up at the same time every day and go to sleep at the same time. Do relaxing activities to wind you down before bed.<\/p>\n<p>Fill your free time with activities that you enjoy. That could be relaxing activities like taking a bath or doing yoga. Or, it could be something that distracts you from cravings, like watching a favorite show or picking up a new hobby.<\/p>\n<p>During the peak of COVID-19, you might have seen a lot of social media posts talking about how being stuck at home was the perfect opportunity to be super-productive. If thinking of it that way helps you, great! But don\u2019t feel bad if all this talk of productivity just stresses you out more. Being stuck at home all the time with stressful events going on all around you isn\u2019t a recipe for productivity. Your goal right now is just to maintain structure and keep yourself sane\u2014not to solve all your problems (let alone everyone else\u2019s).<\/p>\n<h2>Stay in contact with your support system<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to recover from addiction on your own. You may be used to getting your support in person\u2026 but when you can\u2019t, it just makes it that more important to stay in contact in other ways.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in a 12-step program and you have a sponsor, keep in regular contact with them. You may want to make arrangements to talk more often than you normally have in the past\u2014maybe twice a week instead of every other week.<\/p>\n<p>Maintain your social life as best you can. It\u2019s never been easier to video chat with your friends and family than it is now. Take advantage of that! Try reaching out to people you haven\u2019t talked to in a while. This is the perfect excuse to reconnect! You can ask them how they\u2019re holding up, or just chat about whatever. Not every conversation has to be about something intense, like addiction or depression headlines. In fact, it\u2019s important to have plenty of lighthearted conversation to lift your spirits.<\/p>\n<h2>Attend online meetings<\/h2>\n<p>If you normally attend in-person support meetings, attending online can be an adjustment. But the basic idea is the same: you still get to hear each other\u2019s voices\u2014and if you\u2019re video chatting, you get to see each other\u2019s faces too.<\/p>\n<p>Online meetings have been available for a long time, but ever since COVID-19, more and more local meetings are also transitioning online. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aa.org\/pages\/en_US\/options-for-meeting-online\">AA has a web page with information about meeting online<\/a>; it also includes information on how to start your own online meeting. If your local meetings haven\u2019t moved online yet, consider being the one to take the initiative and organize them!<\/p>\n<p>Alcohol not your drug of choice? That\u2019s okay, NA and other 12-step programs are also moving their meetings online. Just google \u201cNA (or CA, HA, etc.) meetings online.\u201d If 12-step programs aren\u2019t your thing, check out alternatives like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartrecovery.org\/smart-recovery-toolbox\/smart-recovery-online\/\">SMART Recovery Online<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most important aspects of recovering from an addiction is finding healthy support systems.
