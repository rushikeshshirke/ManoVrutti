Instead they have a variety of causes, called <strong>risk factors<\/strong>. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop a mental health condition. Sometimes, mental illness develops gradually. Other times, it doesn\u2019t appear until a stressful event <strong>triggers<\/strong> it.<\/p>\n<p>There are many risk factors and triggers, but here are a few examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Genetics. <\/strong>Mental illness often runs in the family.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Environment. <\/strong>Living in a stressful environment can strain your mental health. Things like living in poverty or having an abusive family put a lot of stress on your brain and often trigger mental health concerns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stressful events: <\/strong>like losing a loved one, or being in a car accident.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Childhood trauma.<\/strong> Even if you\u2019re no longer in a stressful environment, things that happened to you as a child can have an impact later in life. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-complex-ptsd\/\">Complex PTSD<\/a> is one particularly common mental health condition among people who grew up in abusive or neglectful environments.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Negative thoughts. <\/strong>Constantly putting yourself down or expecting the worst can get you stuck in a cycle of depression or anxiety.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unhealthy habits: <\/strong>like\u00a0not getting enough sleep, or not eating.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Drugs and alcohol: <\/strong>Abusing drugs and alcohol can be bad for your mental health. It can also make it harder to recover from mental illness.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Brain chemistry.<\/strong> Mental illness often involves an imbalance of natural chemicals in your brain and your body.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These risk factors don\u2019t just affect who will develop a mental illness in the first place. They also affect how severe their symptoms will be, and when they will experience those symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>You can also improve your own mental health by <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-improve-my-mental-health-on-my-own\/\">taking action to reduce your risk factors<\/a>.
