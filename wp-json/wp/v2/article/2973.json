You can\u2019t expect to have a breakthrough every time you walk through the door, but you can expect therapy to lead to positive results over time.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important factors in therapy is your relationship with the therapist. If something\u2019s off in that relationship, it can be hard to make progress.<\/p>\n<h2>When is it time to find a new therapist?<\/h2>\n<p>Therapy can bring up a lot of really uncomfortable feelings. Sometimes you can project those feelings onto your therapist\u2014aren\u2019t they supposed to be making you feel <em>better?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not always that simple. Sometimes things get harder before they get easier. And sometimes we get angry at people who tell us things we need to hear.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel stuck with your therapist, the first thing to do is let them know. Therapists are trained in overcoming obstacles like this. They\u2019ve worked with difficult clients before, so you won\u2019t be the first to express concerns. A good therapist won\u2019t take it personally. Sometimes working through your feelings about your therapist can help uncover an issue you needed to talk about.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve given it your best and it\u2019s still not working out, there\u2019s nothing wrong with looking for a new therapist. But don\u2019t give up on therapy completely! Finding the right therapist is a little like dating. You wouldn\u2019t go on one bad date and give up on dating, would you? So, why try just one therapist and give up on therapy? Just like with other relationships, it takes time to find the right person.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-should-i-look-therapist\">Check out our article on what to look for in a therapist<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Therapy is one of the best ways to improve your mental health\u2014but it\u2019s not always easy.
