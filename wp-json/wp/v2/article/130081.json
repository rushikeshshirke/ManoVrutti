Sometimes, you might feel discouraged or hopeless. It can be hard to study, get work done, or make good decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are effective treatments for ADHD. Many people benefit from some combination of therapy, medications, and\/or lifestyle changes. ADHD doesn\u2019t have to control your life.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most common treatment options for ADHD.<\/p>\n<h2>Medication<\/h2>\n<p>The most common treatment for ADHD is <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/stimulant-medications\/\">stimulant medications, like Ritalin and Adderall<\/a>. These medications have proven to be safe and effective for people with ADHD. [1] But they do have side effects, and they can also be abused. For people with mild ADHD, the side effects can sometimes outweigh the benefits. [2]<\/p>\n<p>Unlike some other mental health medications, stimulants work very quickly. They usually take effect within an hour, and last anywhere from a few hours to most of a day. Many people notice a difference right away. If you take it daily for a week or so and don\u2019t notice any improvements, talk to your doctor about it\u2014you may need a higher dose, or a different medication.<\/p>\n<p>There are also non-stimulant medications for ADHD. The most common is called Strattera (or atomoxetine). These medications still have side-effects, and they\u2019re often less effective than stimulants\u2014but they aren\u2019t habit-forming. [3] Unlike stimulants, you won\u2019t feel the full effect of these medications until you\u2019ve been taking them daily for several weeks.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I literally remember taking a chem test, because that was my first test on medication. So I took it and cried after. It was a relief that it felt so much easier to do things.<\/p>\n<footer>Sydney, 24<\/footer>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m still pretty new to Adderall. I\u2019m still figuring out dosage and such. But especially in that first week realizing the difference. That was shocking to me.<\/p>\n<footer>Allissa, 27<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Therapy and coaching<\/h2>\n<p>Talking to a therapist can be helpful for many people with ADHD. A therapist can help you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deal with negative emotions associated with ADHD, like frustration, discouragement, or a negative self-image.<\/li>\n<li>Identify the problems ADHD is causing in your life, and come up with solutions.<\/li>\n<li>Learn skills that will help you manage your symptoms long-term (unlike medications, which wear off after you stop taking them).<\/li>\n<li>Help you identify and deal with other mental health concerns that might be making things worse. People with ADHD often have other conditions as well, like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/depression\/\">depression<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/anxiety\/\">anxiety<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/bipolar\/\">bipolar disorder<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Therapy takes time\u2014your life probably won\u2019t change overnight. But <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-expect\/\">the benefits of therapy<\/a> also last much longer than medication. People who are in therapy are often able to get by on lower doses of medication. [4]<\/p>\n<p>If you can <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-therapist\/\">find a therapist<\/a> who specializes in ADHD, that can be extra helpful. But even if you can\u2019t, most therapists will be able to help you learn healthy life skills and deal with negative emotions.<\/p>\n<p>ADHD coaching is another option. Compared to therapists, ADHD coaches are less focused on emotions and mostly focused on problem-solving. They\u2019re often people who have ADHD themselves. ADHD coaching isn\u2019t covered by health insurance, so it can be expensive.<\/p>\n<h2>Mindfulness and neurofeedback<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Mindfulness <\/strong>means actively paying attention to the present moment. It\u2019s a skill that you can learn, practice, and get better at over time.<\/p>\n<p>Try it now: <em>What can you see, hear, or smell right now? Are you slouching? Are you holding your breath?\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many of the problems associated with ADHD have to do with not being mentally present. We bump into things because we\u2019re not noticing where our body is in relation to our surroundings. We zone out in the middle of a conversation. We get hyperfocused on a task and forget to step back and look at the big picture. These are all problems that practicing mindfulness can help with.<\/p>\n<p>Some treatments for ADHD make it easier to practice mindfulness. <strong>Neurofeedback <\/strong>is a treatment where our brain signals are translated into something we can see or hear. We might see a line on a computer screen that goes up or down, or hear a sound that gets louder or quieter depending on what our brain is doing. Neurofeedback usually happens in a clinic, but there are now neurofeedback devices you can use at home, like the Muse meditation headband.<\/p>\n<h2>Lifestyle changes<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from formal treatment, there are many things you can do to improve your symptoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-sleep\/\">Sleep deprivation<\/a> can actually <em>cause <\/em>ADHD symptoms. People with ADHD often stay up much later than the average person, making it hard to get enough sleep every night. If you have a sleep disorder, like insomnia or sleep apnea, treating it may also help with your ADHD symptoms. [3]<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get some physical activity in every day. <\/strong>The most helpful kind is aerobic exercise, like jogging or riding a bike. [3] <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/exercising-can-hard-but-good-for-mental-health-9-easy-tips\/\">But even small things can help<\/a>, like taking a walk around the block or just standing up and stretching for a few minutes every hour. This helps you \u201cburn off\u201d some of that hyperactivity, and it gives your brain the stimulation it needs to get things done.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eat nutritious foods.<\/strong> Foods high in protein and fiber will help you maintain a constant energy level. Instead of making a list of foods you \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d eat, focus on trying to increase the amount of healthy food you eat. You\u2019ll naturally feel more full and start to crave sweets less.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Limit your screen time.<\/strong> People with ADHD often spend a <em>lot <\/em>of time playing video games and scrolling endlessly on our phones. [5, 6, 7] Setting limits on screen time is a good idea for everyone, but it might be especially important for those of us with ADHD.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it as easy as possible to live the life you want.<\/strong> Some ideas: Leave your healthy snacks out on the counter where you can see them, and keep the candy in the back of the cupboard where you would have to go out of your way to get it. Keep a calendar on the wall, so it\u2019s easier to remember important events. Turn off app notifications that aren\u2019t important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>Strategies that work for you don\u2019t have to make sense to anybody else.<\/p>\n<footer>Sydney, 24<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Putting it all together<\/h2>\n<p>Different treatments work better for some people than for others. Most people end up using a combination of treatments. For example, you might take medications but also see a therapist and maintain a steady sleep schedule.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to track your symptoms over time. That way, you\u2019ll notice if something changes. Then you can ask your doctor or therapist for help deciding what to try next.<\/p>\n<p>Living with ADHD can be tough, but it doesn\u2019t have to hold you back. With some practice, you can learn to manage it and live a full and happy life.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Clavenna.
