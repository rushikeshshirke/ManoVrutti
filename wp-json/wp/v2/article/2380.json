You\u2019re trying to live your life, but your brain won\u2019t stop focusing on bad things that could happen. Whether or not those things actually will happen, these kinds of thoughts can be frustrating\u2014and exhausting. It takes a lot of energy to be worried all the time!<\/p>\n<p>The emotion you feel when you\u2019re worrying all the time is called <strong>anxiety<\/strong>. Your body tenses up, and your mind becomes fixated on the thing you\u2019re worried about. It can be hard to concentrate on anything else. Anxiety can also affect your appetite and make it hard to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>A little anxiety can be useful. For example, if you\u2019re anxious about an upcoming exam, it might motivate you to study so that you feel more prepared. But anxiety can easily get out of hand. If you\u2019re so anxious that you can\u2019t concentrate on studying, the anxiety is no longer useful.<\/p>\n<h2>Reducing your anxiety in the moment<\/h2>\n<p>If your anxiety has gotten out of hand, the first thing you need to do is bring it down to a manageable level. This can be easier said than done, but with some practice you should be able to find a few <strong>coping skills<\/strong> you can use. A few simple ones you can try are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellhealth.com\/how-to-do-deep-breathing-exercises-1945350\">deep breathing<\/a>, exercise, and writing in a journal.<\/p>\n<p>Once your anxiety is a bit lower, you can start to think about what\u2019s actually going on: <em>What is your anxiety trying to tell you?<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Worrying about real-life problems<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s natural to feel anxious about something that realistically might happen. For example, if you\u2019re about to move to a new city, of course you\u2019re nervous\u2014your whole life is about to change! But once you get there and have had some time to settle in, the anxiety will likely pass.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, give yourself a set amount of time\u2014say, half an hour\u2014to sit with your anxiety. Make a list of everything you can do to prepare for the thing you\u2019re worried about. The next time you feel anxious, use a coping skill to bring your anxiety down to a manageable level, then look at your list and see if there\u2019s anything on it you can do. And if there isn\u2019t? Use a coping skill and move on.<\/p>\n<h2>Irrational worries<\/h2>\n<p>When your worries are about something that\u2019s very unlikely to happen, or if you\u2019re disproportionately worried about something relatively small, your anxiety is considered <strong>irrational<\/strong>. (\u201cIrrational\u201d is another word for \u201cnot realistic.\u201d) Sometimes, when people realize their fears are irrational, they stop worrying about those things. But this doesn\u2019t always happen, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-anxiety\/\">especially if you have an anxiety disorder<\/a>.
