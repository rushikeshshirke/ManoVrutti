It\u2019s normal. Trying to numb the pain of feeling alone is a common reaction- and is very hard to stop.<\/p>\n<p>You may feel alone even when you\u2019re surrounded by people. It hurts when you feel that people who are supposed to love you don\u2019t trust you. Realizing that life isn\u2019t going to be perfect is the start of recovery. Life is hard. That\u2019s the raw truth. The main thing to remember is that you\u2019re not alone.<\/p>\n<h2>Why do I feel alone?<\/h2>\n<p>There are many reasons you may <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/feeling-lonely-crowd\/\">feel alone<\/a>\u2014your living situation, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/mental-health-101\/\">mental health<\/a>, school, relationship troubles, divorce. These factors and many more can lead you to want to turn to drugs or alcohol to mask what\u2019s really going on inside you.<\/p>\n<p>Being with judgmental family members who treat you differently can also make you feel very isolated. For example, holidays can be tough times, especially if there\u2019s fighting going on. Sometimes if you\u2019re living with addiction, your family and friends may not be supportive, or if they\u2019re the ones using, you may feel more alone than ever in your recovery.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, no matter why you feel alone, your feelings are valid. Try not to discount your true feelings. Name them and claim them. While it\u2019s not easy, you have to face them head on so you can feel, acknowledge and address them so you can move forward and continue with recovery.<\/p>\n<h2>Feeling your feelings<\/h2>\n<p>Why is it important to feel your feelings? Because being unable to bear those feelings is what&#8217;s driving you to use. If you expose yourself to the negative feelings without using, you&#8217;ll learn that you can survive loneliness without using or drinking.<\/p>\n<p>Negative emotions like loneliness provide information. If you numb your feelings whenever you start feeling lonely, you won&#8217;t take the necessary steps to become less lonely\u2014like making new friends or learning to maintain healthy relationships. So over time, you&#8217;ll only become more and more lonely. Actually feeling your feelings is a good starting point for making positive changes in your life.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s really difficult and uncomfortable to feel alone, but it will help you heal. Being able to deal with bad feelings is important, even if it feels impossible to do.\u00a0 Ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>What am I actually feeling?\u00a0<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Am I really feeling my feelings?<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>How can I be alone with myself?<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been neglected before or had to take care of yourself and be on your own a lot, it could lead to feeling you\u2019re all alone and that <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/no-one-cares-about-me\/\">no one cares\u2014or that you don\u2019t matter<\/a>.\u00a0 Truly understanding why you\u2019re feeling alone is a major step.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to learn to be alone <em>without<\/em> feeling lonely. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/worksheet-filling-the-void\/\">This worksheet<\/a> can help you fill the void that may lead to using or drinking and explore your feelings.<\/p>\n<h2>How can I feel less alone?<\/h2>\n<p>The overwhelming feelings of loneliness can creep up on you at any time.
