And not being able to sleep even when you\u2019re tired\u2026 well, that\u2019s one of the worst. It\u2019s not great for your mind or body either: sleep is important for your memory, creativity, immune system, and more. So what keeps us from getting the sleep we need, and what can we do about it?<\/p>\n<h2>Why can\u2019t I sleep?<\/h2>\n<p>Lots of things can get in the way of a good night\u2019s sleep. If this is a new problem for you, it may be that you\u2019re stressed out about something that\u2019s just happened or is about to happen. This can happen even if you don\u2019t consciously know what it is you\u2019re worried about\u2014writing in a journal or talking it through with someone else can help you figure things out.<\/p>\n<p>If it\u2019s been going on for a while, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/sleep-disorders\">you could be experiencing a sleep disorder<\/a>. Sometimes sleep disorders happen on their own; other times, they\u2019re a side-effect of <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\">another mental illness<\/a>. Sleep disorders don\u2019t usually go away on their own, so if you think you might have one, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to a doctor about it. Getting treatment for a sleep disorder or a mental illness can do wonders for your sleep!<\/p>\n<p>Whether you have a sleep disorder or not, there\u2019s a lot you can do on your own to improve your sleep, too.<\/p>\n<h2>Sleep hygiene<\/h2>\n<p>When you think of \u201chygiene\u201d, you probably think of showering, brushing your teeth\u2026 Habits that keep you feeling clean and presentable. Your sleep has a lot to do with your habits, too. <strong>Sleep hygiene<\/strong> refers to your sleep-related habits: things that either help or harm your sleep. Here are a few sleep hygiene tips to help you get started improving your sleep:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, or heavy meals<\/strong> for a few hours before bed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep the lights dim, and electronics to a minimum. <\/strong>Bright lights tell your body it\u2019s daytime. Electronics have a bluish tint that makes it even worse. If you can\u2019t avoid using electronics, try installing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/mobile\/how-to-use-blue-light-filter-phone\/\">blue-light filters<\/a> on them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get some physical activity. <\/strong>Don&#8217;t get too hung up on exercising at the &#8220;right&#8221; time of day. What time you do it is less important than just doing it. [1] Do whatever feels best for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use earplugs or white noise <\/strong>to reduce distractions. You can turn on a fan (point it away from you if you\u2019re cold) or listen to recordings of rain or waves.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do something relaxing: <\/strong>go for a walk, take a shower or bath, or play soft music (on a speaker, or on an instrument if you have one!). Or read a book\u2014an actual physical book, or on an e-reader, <em>not<\/em> on your phone!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Only use your bed for sleep<\/strong> (and sex). Reading a book before bed can be relaxing, but find somewhere else to do it. That way, your brain learns: being in bed = time to sleep. If you\u2019ve been lying awake for more than 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing, then try again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/insomnia\/treatment\/what-do-when-you-cant-sleep\">The National Sleep Foundation has lots more sleep hygiene tips<\/a>. Establishing healthy habits can be tough.
