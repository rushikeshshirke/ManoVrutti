How can you manage or avoid those situations? Stress makes everything worse.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Are you getting enough sleep?<\/strong> Not getting enough sleep (especially for days at a time) can indicate that you&#8217;re experiencing other mental health problems, like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-bipolar-disorder\/\">bipolar disorder<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Getting treatment:<\/strong> With treatment, early signs of psychosis can be resolved. Take a comprehensive approach to getting better. Someone can help you with school, work, family life, medications, and relationships. This type of treatment is called Coordinated Specialty Care. Psychosis also responds relatively quickly (within a week) to medications. If you are interested in getting medication, you want to talk to a doctor to find the right kind of medication treatment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t struggle alone, and don&#8217;t wait.
