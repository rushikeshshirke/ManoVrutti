You\u2019re starting to think about <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-stop-drinking\/\">quitting or cutting back<\/a>. Then you look around and see your friends drinking as much as you have been and wonder\u2026 What about them?<\/p>\n<h2>Start with yourself<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re first deciding to cut back on your drinking or quit altogether, the only person you need to worry about is you. That might sound selfish, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s hard enough to quit drinking as it is. Getting sucked into other people\u2019s recoveries is stressful, and stress can be a <strong>trigger<\/strong> for you to drink. You won\u2019t be able to help your friends much if you keep relapsing yourself.<\/p>\n<p>That said, it\u2019s not a bad thing to want your friends to make the same healthy choices as you. You can talk to them about it, provide encouragement, recommend treatment options that have been helpful for you\u2026 But you can\u2019t take responsibility for what they choose to do with your advice.<\/p>\n<h2>Are your friends a negative influence right now?<\/h2>\n<p>Not everyone is going to understand your reasons for changing your own drinking habits. Hopefully your friends will be willing to help you avoid your triggers and have sober fun. But if they insist on drinking a lot while you\u2019re around, they might not be the best influence for you right now.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t really matter whether they won\u2019t stop because they\u2019re alcoholics, or because they just don\u2019t understand. The point is that you need some time away from alcohol, and you need to surround yourself with people who support that goal. It\u2019s hard, but you need to ask yourself whether you need some distance from these friends for a while.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Ultimately it\u2019s up to your friends to decide whether drinking is a problem for them\u2014and what to do about it. In the meantime, do what you need to do to take care of yourself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So you\u2019ve noticed that your drinking has become a problem for you.
