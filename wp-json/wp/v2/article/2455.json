Maybe a relationship just ended, and it seems like it\u2019s your fault. Maybe you\u2019re struggling in school or even dropped out. Maybe you\u2019re pushing your friends and family members away. It could even be something that sounds small to other people but feels huge to you.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-want-to-die\/\">thinking of committing suicide<\/a>, you can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"http:\/\/988lifeline.org\/\">988lifeline.org<\/a>.

Losing a relationship, or a dream, or a belief system, can put you through some dark times. Allow yourself to feel sad about what\u2019s happened.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes what you have to grieve the most is your <strong>expectations<\/strong>. It may be that your life will never be what you thought it would be, or <em>should<\/em> be. To be honest, most people\u2019s lives don\u2019t turn out the way they expected. But with time, you can learn to pick up the pieces, and build something worth living for. People are incredibly <strong>resilient<\/strong>\u2014we bounce back from things we never knew we had the strength for.<\/p>\n<h2>Picking up the pieces<\/h2>\n<p>So how do you put your life back together once you\u2019re finished grieving? Here are a few questions to ask yourself to get started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What do you still have left?<\/strong> It may sound corny, but taking time to think about what you still have, and being grateful for it, can have a real positive impact on your mental health.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What can you still hold on to?<\/strong> Maybe you defined yourself in terms of something that you\u2019ve lost. That can be really disorienting. But whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t the whole picture. You\u2019re still here\u2014what does that look like, and what does that say about what makes you, you?<\/li>\n<li><strong>What makes you feel good?<\/strong> Take a moment to think about your self-care. What makes you feel good? What do you enjoy? What would you like to spend more time doing, seeing, hearing, tasting, experiencing? Start with things that are small and within your reach.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What have you learned?<\/strong> Making mistakes\u2014even really big ones\u2014is how we grow. Nobody who is really successful has gotten there by never making a mistake. Whether you\u2019re going to try again at the same things, or find a new goal to pursue, you\u2019ll be approaching it with more knowledge and experience than you had before.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"round-tl aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/kintsugi-bowl-sm.jpg\" alt=\"A ceramic bowl, broken and repaired with gold.\" \/><figcaption>Image source: Wikimedia Foundation<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>This photograph shows a ceramic dish that has been broken\u2014and repaired with gold.

Picking up the pieces might not leave you with the life you dreamed of, but you may be surprised at what you can build.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are lots of reasons you might feel like your life is over.
