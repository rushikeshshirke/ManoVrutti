[1]<\/p>\n<p>Up to 30 percent of people who use marijuana at least once a year may be either physically dependent on it (they get withdrawal symptoms when they stop using it) or have what is called a marijuana use disorder (an addiction). [2]<\/p>\n<p>So yes, you can smoke weed without being addicted. A lot of people experiment with marijuana\u2014especially in their teens or young adult years\u2014and then stop as they grow up. Some people will recreationally use marijuana their whole lives without being addicted. There are regular pot users over the age of 65.<\/p>\n<p>But for others, marijuana use can become problematic. Some research shows that using marijuana can set off psychosis early in people who are already at risk. [3] People who develop an addiction may see problems in school, work, or relationships. And the habit can be expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Marijuana is increasingly legal or decriminalized all over the country, so it may be legal for adults to use where you live. And it is possible to experiment without becoming addicted. You just have to be prepared for the consequences that come with that, which could include everything from losing scholarships at school to having to pay fines, or even going to jail.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>McCarthy.
