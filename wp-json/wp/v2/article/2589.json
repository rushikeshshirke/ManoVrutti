It can be tempting to act on what you\u2019re feeling right away, but that often doesn\u2019t fix the situation that caused the emotions. In fact, it may lead to more problems to deal with down the road.<\/p>\n<p>This infographic outlines some helpful and less-helpful ways of dealing with your emotions. Scroll down for a web-friendly version of the same advice!<\/p>\n<p><em>This infographic is from Mental Health America&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/mhanational.org\/previous-years-back-school-toolkit-materials\">2017 Back to School Toolkit<\/a>.

When people deny that they are having problematic feelings, those feelings can bottle up to a point that a person ends up \u201cexploding\u201d or acting out in a harmful way.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mhanational.org\/sites\/default\/files\/withdrawal.PNG\" alt=\"\" \/>Withdrawal<\/h3>\n<p>Withdrawal is when a person doesn\u2019t want to be around, or participate in activities with other people. This is different than wanting to be alone from time to time, and can be a warning sign of depression. Some people may withdraw because being around others takes too much energy, or they feel overwhelmed. Others may withdraw because they don\u2019t think other people like them or want them to be around. In some cases, people who have behaviors that they are ashamed of may withdraw so other people don\u2019t find out about what they are doing. But withdrawal brings its own problems: extreme loneliness, misunderstanding, anger, and distorted thinking. We need to interact with other people to keep us balanced.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mhanational.org\/sites\/default\/files\/bullying.PNG\" alt=\"\" \/>Bullying<\/h3>\n<p>Bullying is when a person uses force, threats, or ridicule to show power over others. People typically take part in bullying behavior because they don\u2019t feel good about themselves and making someone else feel bad makes them feel better about themselves or feel less alone. It is harmful to both the bully and the person being bullied and does not address underlying issues.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mhanational.org\/sites\/default\/files\/self%20harm.PNG\" alt=\"\" \/>Self-Harm<\/h3>\n<p>Self-harm can take many forms, including: cutting, starving one\u2019s self, binging and purging, or participating in dangerous behavior. Many people self-harm because they feel like it gives them control over emotional pain. While self-harming may bring temporary relief, these behaviors can become addictive and can lead people to be more out of control and in greater pain than ever.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mhanational.org\/sites\/default\/files\/substance%20use.PNG\" alt=\"\" \/>Substance Use<\/h3>\n<p>Substance use is the use of alcohol and other drugs to make a person feel better or numb about painful situations. Alcohol and drug use can damage the brain, making it need higher amounts of substances to get the same effect. This can make difficult feelings even worse and in some cases, leads to suicidal thoughts or addiction. If you are concerned about your own or someone else\u2019s use of drugs or alcohol, talk to a responsible adult right away to get help.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;PATH&#8221;: 4 helpful steps<\/h2>\n<p>The good news is that with practice, everyone can do a better job of dealing with their negative emotions in healthy ways. One way to deal with uncomfortable or unpleasant emotions is to remember the word PATH. <strong>PATH<\/strong> stands for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pause<\/li>\n<li>Acknowledge<\/li>\n<li>Think<\/li>\n<li>Help<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step 1: Pause.<\/h3>\n<p>This step is important because instead of acting on feelings right away, you stop yourself and think things through. Count to 100 or say the alphabet backwards.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Acknowledge What You\u2019re Feeling.<\/h3>\n<p>For example, are you mad at someone, or are you sad because your feelings were hurt by what they did? Whatever it is that you are feeling, it is ok to feel that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Think.<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have taken a few moments to figure out what exactly it is that you are feeling, think about how you can make yourself feel better.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Help.<\/h3>\n<p>Take an action to help yourself based upon what you came up with in the \u201cThink\u201d step.<\/p>\n<h2>Some more helpful strategies<\/h2>\n<h3>Mood Boosters<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the story of someone you admire<\/li>\n<li>Watch a funny YouTube video<\/li>\n<li>Play with an animal<\/li>\n<li>Watch a movie you loved when you were younger<\/li>\n<li>Reorganize your room<\/li>\n<li>Make a list of places you want to travel<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Address Your Basic Needs<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Eat a healthy snack.<\/li>\n<li>Drink a glass of water.<\/li>\n<li>Take a shower or bath.<\/li>\n<li>Take a nap.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Process Feelings<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Draw how you\u2019re feeling.<\/li>\n<li>Make a gratitude list.<\/li>\n<li>Punch a pillow.<\/li>\n<li>Scream.<\/li>\n<li>Let yourself cry.<\/li>\n<li>Rip paper into small pieces.<\/li>\n<li>Vent.

Keep the letter a couple of days and then tear it up. Stick to pen and paper\u2014using social media when you are highly emotional can be tempting, but you might say something you regret.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Problem Solving<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a list of solutions to problems \u2013 it can help to brainstorm with a friend of family member.<\/li>\n<li>Make a list of your strengths.
