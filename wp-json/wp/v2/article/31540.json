When you see the world through a negative lens, it can feel like everything is terrible and there\u2019s no way out. Life is hard, and you can\u2019t think your way out of every problem\u2014but you <em>can<\/em> learn to think more clearly and positively. And that makes it much easier to enjoy life and find solutions to your problems!<\/p>\n<h2>How do our thoughts get stuck in the first place?<\/h2>\n<p>The world is a complicated place. Our lives are always changing. We encounter new situations to deal with\u2014taxes, dating, school, driving\u2026the list goes on and on. It\u2019s all a lot to process, and our brains are doing the best they can!<\/p>\n<p>Our brains take a lot of shortcuts. Most of the time, our mental shortcuts do a good job of helping us cope with life without getting overwhelmed by all the details. In fact, they work so well that we usually don\u2019t even notice them.<\/p>\n<p>But sometimes, we get stuck. The shortcuts that used to help us start to hold us back. We start to feel trapped in our negative thinking. We might feel <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/anxiety\/\">anxious<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/depression\/\">depressed<\/a>, or have trouble solving our problems.<\/p>\n<p>One example of a mental shortcut is <strong>overgeneralizing<\/strong>. Your brain relies on past experience to predict the future. If you failed at something on your first try, you might automatically assume that you will <em>never<\/em> succeed. The truth is that most of the time, we suck at new things the first time we try them. Trying again anyway is how we experience the satisfaction and pride that come from learning and growing\u2014but it\u2019s hard to remember that when your brain is trying to protect you from being disappointed or embarrassed.<\/p>\n<h2>Breaking free of thinking traps<\/h2>\n<p>Each of us is unique, and so are our thoughts. But people do tend to get stuck in similar patterns of thinking. These patterns are called <strong>thinking traps<\/strong>. Everyone gets caught in these traps sometimes\u2014but with some help, you can learn to break free of them!<\/p>\n<p><em>(If you\u2019ve ever taken a psychology class, you may have learned about \u201ccognitive distortions\u201d. Counselors in the criminal justice system often talk about \u201cthinking errors\u201d. Some people like to call them \u201cautomatic negative thoughts\u201d, or ANTs. These are all ways of saying the same thing!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Breaking free of thinking traps is all about <strong>reframing<\/strong> your thoughts. When you reframe a thought, you look for new ways to think about the thing that\u2019s bothering you. It takes practice to learn how to reframe your thoughts. But with time, you can learn to not only <em>think<\/em> more positively, but to actually change the things you <em>believe<\/em> about yourself.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019re learning to reframe your thoughts, keep a couple things in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Try not to beat yourself up.<\/strong> Everyone gets stuck in thinking traps. Getting out of them takes time, and you\u2019ll probably mess up along the way. Beating yourself up is like flailing in the water when someone is trying to rescue you\u2014it will only make things worse!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t have to hide your <em>feelings<\/em><\/strong> to reframe your <em>thoughts<\/em>. If you\u2019re having really negative thoughts about a breakup, you can tell yourself a more positive version of the story\u2014while still being sad that it happened.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div

unstuck:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Filtering<\/strong> is when you ignore anything that contradicts what you already believe to be true. If you think, \u201cno one ever appreciates me,\u201d you might ignore all the times people <em>have<\/em> expressed appreciation for you (even if it\u2019s not as often as you like). If you think, \u201cI\u2019m a failure,\u201d you might think that everything bad that happens is your fault\u2014while everything good that happens is just a fluke.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Also called:<\/strong> overgeneralizing; disqualifying the positive<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to reframe:<\/strong> Look for evidence that contradicts the negative beliefs you have about yourself. Think of a time when things did turn out well for you, or focus on a person who does care about you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>By the way,<\/strong> focusing only on the positives can get you in trouble too! For example, you might think about how good you\u2019ll feel during a night of partying, but forget how hungover you\u2019ll be in the morning.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>&#8220;All or nothing&#8221; thinking <\/strong>is when you only see the most extreme possibilities: \u201cEither I\u2019m the best, or I\u2019m the worst.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m either going to become famous, or I\u2019m a nobody.\u201d \u201cIf I don\u2019t get an A+, I might as well have gotten an F.\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Also called:<\/strong> &#8220;black and white&#8221; thinking; splitting; thinking in extremes<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to reframe:<\/strong> Think of all the possibilities in between the two extremes. \u201cFind the shades of gray.\u201d Try to make peace with being a normal person, who is good at some things and bad at others!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Jumping to conclusions<\/strong> is when you skip steps in your logic. You might try <strong>mind-reading<\/strong>\u2014guessing what other people are thinking without really knowing. You might <strong>take things personally<\/strong> when they really have nothing to do with you. When you <strong>catastrophize<\/strong>, you focus on the worst possible outcome and convince yourself that it will definitely happen.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to reframe:<\/strong> Write down all the steps it takes to get to the conclusion. Figure out which steps you\u2019re skipping. Look for the flaws in your logic. Try to think of other possible interpretations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Here\u2019s an example:<\/strong> Say your thought is, \u201cHe didn\u2019t even say hi when he came in. He must hate me!\u201d Well, there are lots of reasons why someone might not say hello. Maybe he\u2019s having a bad day. Maybe he\u2019s shy, and he was hoping you\u2019d say hi first. Or maybe you <em>did<\/em> say hi, but he didn\u2019t hear you. Worst case scenario: Maybe he\u2019s just rude!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u201cShould\u201d statements<\/strong> involve putting pressure on yourself to act in a certain way. Some therapists call this \u201cshould-ing all over yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to reframe:<\/strong> Identify where your expectations are coming from. Who exactly says that you should act a certain way? Are their expectations realistic? Does it actually matter what they think? What do <em>you<\/em> want? What are the pros and cons?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Tunnel vision<\/strong> is when you focus on just one thing and ignore everything else. When you feel bad <em>now<\/em>, it\u2019s easy to feel like things have always been this way\u2014and they always will be. It\u2019s also easy to forget that your actions have long-term consequences.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Also called:<\/strong> selective memory; short-term thinking<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to reframe:<\/strong> Think of a time when you felt better than you do now. Imagine a time in the future when you might feel that way again. If you can, find a pleasant distraction until the worst of it passes. Remember that the only constant in life is change!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>If you want to see more examples of thinking traps, just google \u201ccognitive distortions.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Talk it out<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes other people are able to see our thinking traps better than we can see our own. This is actually one of the main benefits of <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-expect\/\">seeing a therapist<\/a>: therapists are trained to recognize thinking traps and help you get unstuck.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/who-can-i-talk-to-about-my-mental-health\/\">Talking to a friend or family member can be really helpful too<\/a>. Make sure to find someone who can give you constructive feedback in a positive, caring way. You want them to help you reframe your <em>thoughts<\/em> without invalidating your <em>feelings<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-keep-mental-health-journal\/\">Writing in a journal<\/a> isn\u2019t exactly \u201ctalking to someone,\u201d but it\u2019s similar. You can put your thoughts down on paper, and then look at them as if they were someone else\u2019s thoughts. What would you tell a friend who was saying those negative things about themselves? How would you help them focus on the positives?<\/p>\n<p>You can also reframe your thoughts using <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/dealing-with-the-worst-case-scenario\/\">this worksheet<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/diy\/overcoming-negative-thoughts\/\">this interactive activity<\/a>.
