Depression is treatable, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always <em>easy<\/em> to feel better and move on.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/does-depression-go-away-on-its-own\/\">waiting for depression to go away on its own<\/a>, it might be time to start looking into <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-depression\/\">treatment options<\/a>. You can seek professional help from a doctor or therapist, but there are also lots of things you can do to feel better on your own.<\/p>\n<h2>Treatments might take a while to work<\/h2>\n<p>Depression is a long-term illness, and it won\u2019t go away overnight. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-fast-do-depression-meds-work\/\">Antidepressant medications can take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to kick in<\/a>, and sometimes longer to reach their full effect. Therapy is generally considered more effective than medication, and many people feel better after just a few sessions. But it&#8217;s still hard to predict how long it will take to see long-term results. You never know when you\u2019ll have a major breakthrough.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also possible for a treatment to stop working after a while, or not work as well as it used to. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-the-right-medication-for-my-mental-health\/\">You might have to switch medications, change your dosage, or take several medications at once.<\/a> Try telling your doctor or therapist that you feel stuck\u2014they can help you find new things to try.<\/p>\n<h2>You might have to try multiple treatment options<\/h2>\n<p>Depression is a complex condition, with <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-causes-depression\/\">multiple causes<\/a> and many different symptoms. Sometimes a single treatment will target one or two of those, but not all of them. In that case, combining a few different treatments at once can make recovery more likely. For example, therapy and medication are often more effective when used together than either one on their own. [1]<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve mostly tried therapy and medication, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-improve-my-mental-health-my-own\/\">try making some lifestyle changes,<\/a> like eating right and exercising or finding a new hobby. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve avoided therapy and medication in the past, maybe it\u2019s time to give them another look.<\/p>\n<h2>Dealing with treatment-resistant depression<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve tried lots of different treatments for a long time and you still feel depressed, you might have <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-can-i-do-about-treatment-resistant-depression-trd\/\">treatment-resistant depression (TRD)<\/a>. If a doctor diagnoses you with TRD, it opens up some less common treatment options, like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-are-injectable-mental-health-drugs\/\">injectable mental health drugs<\/a>\u00a0like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-ketamine-treat-depression\/\">ketamine<\/a>. But there are other ways to keep fighting too:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look for underlying causes. <\/strong>Sometimes depression is actually a sign of a deeper issue. If that\u2019s the case, treating the depression is only treating the symptom, not the cause. Is there a medical condition that might be contributing? Have you had your thyroid and hormones checked? What about your environment\u2014are you in a toxic relationship or a depressing job?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get screened for other mental illnesses.<\/strong> Lots of people have more than one mental illness. They can feed off each other. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">Take one of our other mental health tests<\/a> to find out if that\u2019s a possibility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Cuijpers et al.
