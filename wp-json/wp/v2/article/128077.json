And you may have started out using or drinking at work to calm your nerves. But now you can\u2019t stop. Drinking or using at work can turn into a problem very quickly. You may <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-feel-out-control\/\">feel you\u2019ve lost control<\/a> and don\u2019t know what to do next. You do have options and you don\u2019t have to face this alone.<\/p>\n<h2>Why am I drinking or using at work?<\/h2>\n<p>Life is hard, especially in the last few years of the pandemic with nonstop layoffs and inflation. It\u2019s enough for anyone to want to escape from the stress of modern life. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-deal-pressure-and-expectations\/\">It\u2019s hard to cope when the pressure is on<\/a>.\u00a0 You may feel anxiety all the time and use alcohol or drugs as a fast-fix to a bigger problem. But ask yourself: <em>What\u2019s really going on here?\u00a0 How did it get to this point?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Depending on your job, you may be under lots of stress. Healthcare workers have to show up for their jobs even when they\u2019re sick, teachers face strikes, and construction workers face extreme weather delays. Depending on the industry, in parts of entertainment or service and hospitality, for example, it might be ok to drink at work. But it\u2019s knowing where the limit is and when to stop.<\/p>\n<p>Drinking at work may have started out as an occasional thing, but now it\u2019s become a compulsion. \u00a0And it\u2019s hard to stop a bad habit. But recovery will happen if you set your mind to it. That\u2019s why you need to arm yourself with the right tools to heal yourself. You are not your <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/addiction\/\">addiction<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How can I stop drinking or using at work?<\/h2>\n<p>First things first &#8211; it\u2019s best not to drink or use at work from the start. The sooner you <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-stop-drinking\/\">stop drinking<\/a> or using at work the better. And the longer you continue to drink or use at work the harder it will be to stop. Here are some things to think about to help you change your drinking or using:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How does drinking or using while working affect your work, your coworkers, or those you support?<\/li>\n<li>Does it violate company rules? Can it lead to significant employment consequences like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-i-be-fired-my-mental-illness\/\">getting fired<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>Are you drinking more and more or in a way that is making it hard to stop?<\/li>\n<li>You might think using is enhancing your performance, but is it really, or does it make you do worse at your job?<\/li>\n<li>You might think people don\u2019t notice, but are you sure? And if they do, do you think that your drinking or using could be impacting them?<\/li>\n<li>Let&#8217;s say you get fired because you were drinking or using. How will that affect your ability to find a job in the future?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Drinking or using at work won\u2019t end well. We all do things we regret. But there is hope. Many people have recovered from their addictions and go on to live productive, healthy lives. You can do it too.<\/p>\n<p>If drinking at work is a sign that you may be dealing with alcohol or substance abuse, it\u2019s OK, and best to seek help and be proactive about your health. Seek resources that your company offers by contacting human resources, talking to a coworker who you trust, and researching information online or in your employee handbook or contract.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding Support<\/h2>\n<p>Significant drug use and drinking will affect your job performance. There are helpful tools to aid you with recovering from addiction.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find addiction support. <\/strong>Reach out to your local outpatient treatment center.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/alcoholics-anonymous\/\">Alcoholics Anonymous AA<\/a> and other recovery groups offer meetings and also provide <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-does-peer-support-look-like\/\">peer supporters who can help you<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consider calling 988 or a warmline.<\/strong> If you need immediate help, you can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"http:\/\/988lifeline.org\/\">988lifeline.org<\/a>.
