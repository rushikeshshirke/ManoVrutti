Fortunately, the big goal of stopping your drug use can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps.<\/p>\n<h2>Manage withdrawal symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>This will be your first hurdle. Any time you cut back on a habit-forming substance, your body goes through\u00a0<strong>withdrawals<\/strong>. Your body has adapted to the amount you\u2019ve been drinking, so cutting back throws your body out of balance. This effect is temporary, but it can be miserable.<\/p>\n<p>The exact withdrawal symptoms depend on the type of drug you\u2019re using, but it\u2019s common to experience things like anxiety, nausea, and trouble sleeping. The heavier your drug use, and the more quickly you stop, the more intense the symptoms will be.<\/p>\n<p>Start by talking to a doctor, who can give you recommendations based on your unique biology and situation. There are also medications that can make it easier to quit taking certain drugs.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn your triggers<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Triggers<\/strong> are things that remind you of drugs and make you crave them. Common triggers include places you\u2019ve done drugs, friends you\u2019ve used with in the past, or anything else that brings up memories of your drug use. You can also experience <em>emotional<\/em> triggers, like depression or anger. Everyone\u2019s triggers are different. You\u2019ll need to learn your own.<\/p>\n<p>Early in the process, it\u2019s best to avoid your triggers as much as possible\u2014especially while you\u2019re still in withdrawal. There may be some triggers you can\u2019t avoid forever, and you\u2019ll eventually need to learn coping skills to face them.<\/p>\n<h2>Address any underlying mental health needs<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drugabuse.gov\/publications\/drugfacts\/comorbidity-substance-use-disorders-other-mental-illnesses\">About half of people who are addicted to drugs also have another mental health condition<\/a>. In fact, many people start taking drugs as a way of self-medicating for an underlying mental illness. Addressing your mental health needs can make it much easier to quit using drugs. If you haven\u2019t yet, take one of our <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mentalhealthamerica.net\/screening-tools\">mental health screens<\/a> to see if you are at risk for a mental illness.<\/p>\n<h2>Long-term recovery<\/h2>\n<p>Many people are able to get clean for a few months, but then go back to using drugs. This is called <strong>relapse<\/strong>. If this happens to you, that\u2019s okay. For many people, relapse is a part of recovery\u2014each time you relapse, you learn more about your triggers, and which coping skills aren\u2019t working for you. The important thing is to keep trying.<\/p>\n<h2>Find help and support<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to quit using drugs on your own. Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to! Supportive family and friends can be a great resource in recovery from drug use. There are also many quality treatment programs around the country who can help you through the steps we\u2019ve laid out here.
