That\u2019s understandable as creating healthy habits may be just as difficult as ending bad ones. Motivation and sticking to a routine can become hard to establish and hard to stick with if results don\u2019t occur as fast as you\u2019d like, or even if you miss one day. But changing your habits is possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can recover and have a better baseline than where you are. You had an inner strength before you used, and it is still there. You just need to find ways to love yourself and get to know yourself again. Once you heal your brain, you will be better able to heal yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Ways to manage your emotions<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>Once you start, things will get better\u2026. It was hard to start at first. Now it\u2019s hard to turn around.<\/p>\n<footer><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josh, 24<\/span><\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many ways you can manage your emotions.\u00a0 Some techniques may take just a few minutes, some you can do in the moment, and others you learn over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/dialectical-behavioral-therapy-dbt\/\"><b>Dialectical behavior therapy<\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DBT)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a type of talk therapy that helps people acknowledge the strong emotions they are feeling and helps them target.\u00a0 And change their behavior patterns. [2] It is a way to feel safe in the moment and choose healthy behaviors. Even if you do not see a therapist\u2014or don\u2019t see a therapist who specializes in DBT\u2014you can still use different DBT strategies like mindfulness and emotional regulation to help you manage your emotions. There are many DBT workbooks available that you can do on your own. Here are few worksheets that can help get you started:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/managing-frustration-and-anger\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing Frustration and Anger\u00a0<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/dialectical-behavioral-therapy-dbt\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpful vs Harmful Ways to Manage Emotions<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/the-path-to-calm-4-steps-to-calm-your-mind\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PATH to Calm: 4 steps to calm your mind<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Self-care<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Self-care<\/strong> is more than bubble baths and treating yourself with gifts. It<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is what you like to do, that regulates yourself and puts you at ease. It&#8217;s a process that promotes your well-being and may include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting outside and being active or taking a walk<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooking, reading a book, playing video games, or rewatching your favorite shows<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating something by drawing, writing, or painting<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listening to music<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resting by taking a nap or getting sleep.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The possibilities are endless when you are looking for one or more purposeful activities to create a healthy relationship with yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Meditation and Movement<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-meditation-improve-my-mental-health\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a technique to train yourself on attention and awareness to become mentally clear and emotionally calm. While it may be difficult at first, anyone can do it and you can do it anywhere. Every tough emotion or thought that appears ends up sitting on a leaf and flowing down the river out of sight and out of their mind. There are plenty of YouTube videos about free-guided meditation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Movement is also a great way to let your emotions out. Anger is an emotion that may be difficult to work through at first, but movement can help you process it.\u00a0 Being angry builds up adrenaline and physical activity gives you a non-destructive outlet. Going to the gym, dancing, going on a walk or run, etc. can give you a non-destructive way to deal with anger and even other emotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Grounding Skills<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grounding skills help you be more aware in the moment. They usually have you use one or more of your five senses to distract you from a variety of emotions, feelings, or thoughts. Here are two that you may want to try:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The RAIN method:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Recognize<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> what is going on<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Allow<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> yourself the experience to just sit and be<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Investigate<\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why you\u2019re feeling what you\u2019re feeling while being patient and kind to yourself<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Natural awareness<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, focus on who you are as a person\u2014you are more than the emotion (ex: sadness, anger, frustration, etc.) that you are currently feeling. [3]<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Five Senses Technique<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the 5 senses technique you notice and list (either silently or out loud)<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 things you can see<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 things you can touch<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 things you can hear<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 things you can smell<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 thing you can taste.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This skill brings you into the moment of where you are, and takes you away from your racing thoughts or emotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>EFT Tapping<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotional Freedom Technique\u2014or EFT Tapping has been found to be an effective way to help people cope with anxiety and troubling thoughts. [4] Here is how you do EFT tapping [5]:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about what is troubling and write down a statement about it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assign it on a scale of 1-10 measuring how bad this makes you feel.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, using your fingertips to tap different points of your body on your palm, head, chest, and torso repeating your statement while doing it.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you finish, evaluate how you feel. The goal is to lower your score from before. You can repeat the process if needed.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people in recovery have found tapping to be helpful when dealing with difficult emotions or handling cravings for their drug of choice. You can find a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/healthy.kaiserpermanente.org\/health-wellness\/health-encyclopedia\/he.emotional-freedom-technique-eft.acl9225\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full explanation on how to do EFT tapping here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Creating a support system<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a support system can be a very difficult thing to do because it\u2019s hard to admit you may have a problem. But a support system is one of the most important tools for managing emotions. You may be surprised to find that others have been in the same situation as you are once before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0A support system can be as big or as small as you\u2019d like for it to be, and they include whom you feel the safest with. Setting boundaries during these meetings, such as asking for no one else to talk just listen, will help in creating a safe environment for you to let all your feelings out and to really be heard.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your support system may also include online communities, a sponsor or friends from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/alcoholics-anonymous\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12-step meetings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-does-peer-support-look-like\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a peer recovery specialist<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/need-talk-someone-warmlines\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calling a warmline<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are making a huge step on your healing journey by changing how you cope with strong, negative emotions. There are many different paths you can take to get more of a control of your emotions. What works for some may not work for others. Keep focusing on the positive changes you want to make and look towards others who may provide support when you feel like you are lacking. Just remember, you are working towards re-building your inner strength and loving yourself again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brain recovery after alcohol and other drug use<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
