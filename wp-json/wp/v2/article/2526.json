We don&#8217;t get as much face time with each other as we used to.<\/p>\n<p>Many people to feel like they don\u2019t have a support system there to help them. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/im-feeling-lonely\/\">Feelings of isolation and loneliness <\/a>can bring themselves to the forefront of daily life. It is important to know that you are not alone, and that there are things you can do to mitigate these feelings.<\/p>\n<h2>Use coping skills<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s okay to feel lonely or isolated. If these emotions are making you feel more anxious or depressed, think about the coping skills you have available. These might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-to-keep-a-mental-health-journal\/\">Taking twenty minutes to journal<\/a> about exactly how you are feeling<\/li>\n<li>Getting some exercise, or simply spending time outdoors<\/li>\n<li>Practicing <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/8-best-meditation-apps\">meditation using an app<\/a> or prerecorded video<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Find ways to let your emotions out in a healthy way. Burying your emotions isn&#8217;t a good long-term solution\u2014sooner or later, they\u2019ll come out anyway!<\/p>\n<h2>Find ways to have human connection each day<\/h2>\n<p>Even though the world has generally &#8220;re-opened&#8221;, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a lasting effect on the way people connect with each other. More people are working from home than ever before, and fewer people are connected to churches and other community organizations. Yet feeling connected is as important as ever. There are still plenty of ways to stay connected, but they might take a little more effort than they used to.<\/p>\n<p>Connecting with other people in person is best, but not always possible. Call family members or friends when feelings of isolation set in, or make weekly virtual plans to eat together, talk, or watch a movie together. Ensuring that you have some social interaction each day\u2014even if virtually\u2014can make a huge difference.<\/p>\n<h2>Join online communities<\/h2>\n<p>If you need more connection with others or resources for mental health, <a href=\"\/connect\">joining online communities<\/a> can be a good way to find both. Through these communities, you can find people from all over the world who may be experiencing or have experienced the same feelings and emotions that you are. This is an excellent way to gain support from others while also learning new information about topics that you may be interested in.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/members.osmind.org\/\">Osmind\u00a0offers an online patient community<\/a> for people with treatment-resistant mental health disorders, their mental health providers, and those passionate about innovative mental health treatments.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, take care of yourself. Eat what will make you happy. Choose to disengage from technology if you aren\u2019t feeling it. Get some physical activity if it makes you feel good and you have the ability to. We are living through a unique combination of connectivity and isolation, with a whole host of new and sometimes terrifying experiences and emotions. Just getting through it is an immense accomplishment!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Somehow, the more virtually connected the world has become, the more isolated many of us feel.
