Even just figuring out that you <em>have<\/em> bipolar disorder is hard enough! Taking the first steps to get better is really brave. But it can be really discouraging when you start a treatment\u2026 only to discover that it\u2019s actually making you feel <em>worse<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p>First off, know that this isn\u2019t unusual. Many people experience side-effects from their medications. It\u2019s also not the end of the road\u2014when you know what <em>doesn\u2019t<\/em> work, you\u2019re one step closer to finding what <em>does<\/em> work. It\u2019s all part of the recovery process.<\/p>\n<h2>Side-effects<\/h2>\n<p>Pretty much all medications have side-effects. Some are really serious, and others are just strange or annoying. Everyone\u2019s body is different: not everyone experiences every side-effect to the same degree. Some people might not notice any at all.<\/p>\n<p>Each medication will have different side-effects, but some common ones with <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-meds-treat-bipolar\/\">bipolar medications<\/a> include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dizziness or nausea<\/li>\n<li>Drowsiness or fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Frequent urination, dry mouth, or increased thirst<\/li>\n<li>Hands, face, or other muscles twitching<\/li>\n<li>Weight gain<\/li>\n<li>Acne or skin rash<\/li>\n<li>Blurred vision<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When a doctor prescribes a medication, they consider the possible side-effects as well as the positive effects of the medication. If they think the benefits outweigh the risks, they\u2019ll prescribe the medication. Doctors generally know a lot about how medications affect <em>most people<\/em>\u2014but your experience might be different. If you don\u2019t like the way a medication makes you feel, talk to your doctor about other options.<\/p>\n<h2>Dealing with side-effects<\/h2>\n<p>Some side-effects can be serious. Your doctor should warn you of serious side-effects when they prescribe a medication. They\u2019ll usually tell you to stop taking a medication immediately if you experience any of these.<\/p>\n<p>Less serious side-effects sometimes go away on your own. If you\u2019re experiencing something that is unpleasant but bearable, it might be worth powering through the first few weeks to see if it gets better. Still, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor as soon as possible to make sure it isn\u2019t a sign of something more serious.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes your doctor might prescribe a second medication to counteract the side-effects of the first one. This might seem like a lot\u2014if you don\u2019t like the idea of being on so many medications, your doctor should take that into account. But many people take multiple meds for their mental health and do just fine, so it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.<\/p>\n<p>If the side-effects are completely unbearable and they don\u2019t go away with time, you can talk to your doctor about other options. They may switch you to a different medication, or recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-bipolar\/\">another type of treatment<\/a> entirely.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to stop taking your bipolar meds, don\u2019t stop all at once\u2014this can make the side-effects worse, and can even trigger a manic or depressive episode. Instead, gradually decrease the dose. If the medication comes in a tablet, you can do this just by breaking them in half. Otherwise, your doctor can give you smaller pills so you can taper off over the course of a few weeks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seeking treatment for bipolar disorder can be hard.
