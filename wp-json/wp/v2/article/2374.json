Your body tenses up, and your mind becomes fixated on the thing you\u2019re worried about. It can be hard to concentrate on anything else. Anxiety can also affect your appetite and make it hard to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>A little anxiety can be useful. For example, if you\u2019re anxious about an upcoming exam, it might motivate you to study so that you feel more prepared. But anxiety can easily get out of hand. If you\u2019re so anxious that you can\u2019t concentrate on studying, the anxiety is no longer useful.<\/p>\n<p>When anxiety gets so out of hand that it starts to interfere with your daily life, you might have an <strong>anxiety disorder<\/strong>. Anxiety disorders are a type of mental health condition. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/are-there-types-anxiety\/\">Some examples include<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)<\/li>\n<li>Social anxiety<\/li>\n<li>Phobias<\/li>\n<li>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)<\/li>\n<li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What they all have in common is experiencing extreme amounts of anxiety\u2014more than the average person would experience in the same situation, and enough to interfere with the person&#8217;s daily life.<\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of an anxiety disorder<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone\u2019s experience with anxiety is different, but some of the common symptoms of anxiety disorders include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling restless and irritable<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty concentrating<\/li>\n<li>Muscle pain, tightness, or soreness<\/li>\n<li>Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep<\/li>\n<li>Feeling exhausted even after a full night\u2019s sleep<\/li>\n<li>Going out of your way to avoid situations that make you anxious<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/types-of-intrusive-thoughts\/\">Intrusive thoughts (unwanted thoughts or worries that won\u2019t go away)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Many people with anxiety <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-depression\/\">also experience depression<\/a>. Because there\u2019s some overlap in symptoms, sometimes people who have both conditions only get diagnosed with one.<\/p>\n<h2>Life problems<\/h2>\n<p>For people who have anxiety, the symptoms cause serious problems in their lives. Difficulty concentrating can make it hard to do well in school or at work. Many people take extreme measures to avoid situations that might trigger their anxiety. They might isolate themselves from others, avoid public spaces, or change their daily routines to avoid something that makes them anxious.<\/p>\n<h2>Panic attacks<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-are-panic-attacks\/\">People with anxiety disorders often experience panic attacks<\/a>. Panic attacks look different for everyone, but people often describe having trouble breathing, feeling like they\u2019re going to pass out or even die, and feeling detached from their surroundings. Panic attacks can be scary, but they\u2019re not life-threatening and they can be treated.<\/p>\n<h2>Trauma<\/h2>\n<p>Some people develop anxiety disorders as a way of protecting themselves. If you\u2019ve experienced a traumatic event in the past, you might feel anxious any time you\u2019re reminded of the event, even if you\u2019re safe now. Working through your trauma can help you treat your anxiety disorder.<\/p>\n<h2>Treatment and recovery<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-anxiety\/\">Anxiety disorders are treatable<\/a>. Many people benefit from some combination of therapy, medications, and\/or lifestyle changes. Anxiety doesn\u2019t have to control your life!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/anxiety\/\">free online anxiety test<\/a> can help you find out if you\u2019re at risk for an anxiety disorder.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about anxiety disorders, check out this video made by our friends at the Kendall College of Art and Design:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Video by the Epic Project: Anxiety\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/r3P2NO71N1U?enablejsapi=1\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ul>\n<li>American Psychiatric Association.
