It can help give you a sense of what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p>It can be hard to wrap your head around what\u2019s going on with your own mental health. There are so many different mental health conditions, each with their own symptoms, causes, and treatments. Many people experience more than one mental health condition at once. Our mental health can get better or worse over time. And to be honest, humans can be pretty bad at understanding what\u2019s going on in our own minds!<\/p>\n<p>This is where mental health testing comes in. Online mental health testing is great for two things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying what kinds of mental health challenges you\u2019re facing\u2014which helps you figure out what next steps to take.<\/li>\n<li>Keeping track of your mental health over time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about each of these.<\/p>\n<h2>Identifying what\u2019s going on<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re on this site, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re having a hard time (or someone you care about is). You don\u2019t need a test to tell you that! But just knowing that something feels \u201coff\u201d only gets you so far. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/am-i-depressed-or-just-sad\/\">Are you just sad, or are you depressed<\/a>? When you can\u2019t sit still, is that because you\u2019re anxious or do you have ADHD? These are different problems with different solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Our mental health tests are <strong>scientifically validated screening tools<\/strong>. That means that researchers have proven that they do a good job of showing who might have a mental health condition and who probably doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Still, to get \u201cofficially\u201d diagnosed with a mental health condition, you\u2019ll need to have a conversation with a mental health professional. They can pick up on things that simply don\u2019t come through in an online test. Family doctors can often diagnose common conditions like depression and anxiety. But if you can, try to find someone who specializes in mental health, like a therapist or a psychiatrist.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-mental-illness-do-i-have\/\">Sometimes finding the \u201cright\u201d diagnosis can be a journey<\/a>. Mental health is complicated, because our minds are complicated! If you\u2019ve gotten a diagnosis that doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s okay to get a second opinion. You can also come back here and take more mental health tests\u2014maybe you\u2019ll find a better way to describe the experiences you\u2019re having.<\/p>\n<h2>Keeping track of your mental health over time<\/h2>\n<p>Most of our mental health tests will either give you a \u201cpositive\u201d result (yes, you probably have X) or a \u201cnegative\u201d one (no, you probably don\u2019t have X). Some of them give you a bit more detail. (Do you have mild depression or severe depression?)<\/p>\n<p>But all of them also give you a <em>number score<\/em>. A lot of research goes into how we translate those scores into a result (5-9 is \u201cmild depression\u201d and 10-14 is \u201cmoderate\u201d). But to track your mental health over time, all you need to remember is that a higher number means more severe symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>If I got a 10 on the Depression Test last week and a 14 this week, I\u2019m still in the \u201cmoderate\u201d range, but this helps me see that I might be struggling a bit more right now. Maybe it\u2019s time to do some self-care or make an appointment with my therapist.<\/p>\n<p>Bonus: if you <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/log-in\/\">log into the site<\/a>, you can see all your past results in a nice little chart that shows you how your symptoms have changed over time.<\/p>\n<h2>Okay, sounds great! So how exactly do I do all this?<\/h2>\n<p>Taking a mental health test is pretty easy. Just <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">go to our list of mental health tests<\/a>, pick the one you want to take, and answer the questions. It\u2019s free, and you\u2019ll get your results right away.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re just doing a quick mental health check, you\u2019re done! But you might as well get all you can out of the test, right? One way to do that is to save your results so you can see them again later. Here are some ways to do that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Print out your results<\/strong> and show them to a supportive friend, family member, or mental health professional (doctor or therapist). Starting a conversation about mental health can be hard, but having some concrete test results can make it a little easier.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email them to yourself.<\/strong> Just click the \u201cEmail Results\u201d button on the results page and enter your email address. You can forward it to whoever needs to see it, or just show them on your phone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bookmark the results page.<\/strong> Each screening result has its own unique URL. If you bookmark that page or copy the URL and save it somewhere, you can always refer back to it later.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Log in to save your results.<\/strong> This is the best way. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/sign-up\/\">Creating a login<\/a> is free and quick, and it automatically saves all your results so you can come back to them later. There\u2019s even a little chart that shows when your scores go up or down!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_84996\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84996\" style=\"width: 555px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-84996\" src=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/track-results-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"555\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/track-results-example.png 1105w, https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/track-results-example-768x643.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-84996\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example of mental health test results tracked over time.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How often should I take a mental health test?<\/h2>\n<p>If your results say you are \u201clow risk\u201d or unlikely to have the mental health condition you tested for\u2026 It\u2019s a good idea to take the test again in 4-6 weeks.

Mental health conditions <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/does-mental-illness-go-away-its-own\/\">generally don\u2019t magically get better on their own<\/a>.
