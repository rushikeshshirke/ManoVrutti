But today, many mental health specialists agree that <em>behaviors<\/em> can be addictive, too. Treatments have been developed for sex addiction, gambling addiction, food addiction, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>People also throw the word \u201caddiction\u201d around a lot in everyday conversation: \u201cI\u2019m <em>so<\/em> addicted to chocolate!\u201d It can make it hard to understand where to draw the line between being addicted to something and just doing it a lot. Especially since most of these behaviors are fine in moderation\u2014some are even healthy (like sex) or even necessary (like food)! So how can you tell when your behavior is becoming a problem?<\/p>\n<h2>Definition of behavioral addictions<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no single agreed-upon definition of behavioral addictions. But they\u2019re generally defined similarly to drug and alcohol addictions. Here\u2019s what you get if you adapt the guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine [1] to other behaviors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can\u2019t stop doing it<\/strong>\u2014at least not for long. You might try for a while, but you keep going back for more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You can\u2019t stop thinking about it.<\/strong> When you\u2019re not doing it, you\u2019re thinking about it. You might be willing to do extreme or dangerous things to keep doing it (like stealing money so that you can keep gambling, for example).<\/li>\n<li><strong>You have trouble managing your emotions.<\/strong> The behavior replaces your other coping skills. You become more sensitive to stress. You have a harder time identifying exactly what it is you\u2019re feeling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It interferes with your daily life or your relationships.<\/strong> Over time, your behavior gets more and more out of control. Your time and money go toward supporting your addiction in place of your other responsibilities. Other people start to become frustrated with your behavior.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You have less and less awareness of the negative consequences.<\/strong> The longer your behavior continues, the less you notice how it\u2019s affecting you and the people around you. Even extremely severe negative consequences, like losing your job or failing classes, are not enough to motivate you to stop. Often other people notice that the behavior is a problem before you do.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What kinds of things can be addictive?<\/h2>\n<p>Addiction is a mental illness that involves the reward pathways of your brain. [2] Anything that activates these reward pathways can become addictive. Some things, like sex and gambling, are more likely to do this than others. But really, pretty much anything that feels good can become addictive. It depends less on the behavior itself, and more on how that behavior makes <em>you<\/em> feel.<\/p>\n<h2>Behavioral addiction and other mental illnesses<\/h2>\n<p>Research shows that people who struggle with behavioral addictions are also more likely to be addicted to drugs or alcohol. Addiction treatment professionals sometimes talk about people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellmind.com\/to-maintain-abstinence-avoid-substituting-addictions-69439\">substituting one addiction for another<\/a>\u2014maybe you stopped drinking, but you started overeating instead. Don\u2019t get discouraged: recovering from one addiction actually makes you <em>less<\/em> likely to develop another addiction. [3]<\/p>\n<p>Many people who live with addiction also have at least one other type of mental illness. [4] You might hear professionals call this <strong>dual diagnosis<\/strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>co-occurring disorders<\/strong>. Treatment for co-occurring disorders is most effective when it addresses each of the conditions rather than just focusing on one or the other. Fortunately, many of the treatments for addiction also address other mental illnesses, and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>American Society of Addiction Medicine.
