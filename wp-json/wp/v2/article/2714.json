Emotional support is a basic human need but over 50 million Americans aren\u2019t getting enough of it. Happy was created to ensure people have instant access to the empathy and encouragement they need to thrive.<\/p>\n<h3>Who will you talk to?<\/h3>\n<p>Over 2400 people have been accepted into our community of Happy Givers, people who have demonstrated a gift for deep listening and acceptance; they are non-judgmental, naturally affirming of others, and ask questions that help callers gain fresh perspective. To ensure Happy provides callers with the highest quality of support, those applying to be a Giver undergo a thorough evaluation process. It begins with an initial over-the-phone interview, an understanding of guidelines, assessment and a mock call. Approved Givers then must pass a background check and take a test confirming comprehension of Happy\u2019s guidelines before they can begin taking calls. Support Givers are rated at the end of each call to continually hone our intelligent caller-giver matching system and quality of the Happy experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Pricing Information<\/h2>\n<p>We want to provide affordable access to the emotional support you deserve. Rates are only $12 per half hour, prorated per minute, so you only pay for the time you need. Plus your first call is free!<\/p>\n<h3>How do I start?<\/h3>\n<p>Download the app, set up a brief profile and hit \u201cconnect.\u201d You will be matched with a Happy Giver. We all experience moments when we can benefit from extra support. Some moments are life changing\u2014 becoming a parent, moving to a new city, or losing a loved one. Others are part of everyday life\u2014feeling discouraged at work, frustrated with a spouse, or simply feeling self-critical. Happy provides you with a safe space to talk about whatever you want for as long as you want.<\/p>\n<h2>Privacy Information<\/h2>\n<p>Only the first name you provide is shared with your Happy Giver \u2013 they receive no other identifying information (no last name, no location, no phone number).<\/p>\n<h2>Other Info<\/h2>\n<p>Happy Givers are not licensed professionals \u2013 they are everyday people who are extraordinary at giving support.
