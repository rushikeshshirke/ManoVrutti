The withdrawals can be absolutely miserable, including some of the following symptoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agitation and anxiety<\/li>\n<li>Muscle aches and abdominal cramps<\/li>\n<li>Inability to sleep<\/li>\n<li>Runny nose, teary eyes, sweating<\/li>\n<li>Nausea and vomiting<\/li>\n<li>Dilated pupils, goosebumps<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fortunately, there are more comfortable ways to stop using heroin than quitting on your own. Talk to a doctor about taking a medication such as suboxone or methadone, which can help reduce the withdrawal symptoms and make it easier to stay off heroin for good. It\u2019s also helpful to tell someone you trust, so that they can be available to help if you experience any trouble. Addiction treatment centers or support groups like Heroin Anonymous are also helpful for many people.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ul>\n<li>A.D.A.M.
