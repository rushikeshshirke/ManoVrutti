In some cases, you may also give further background information about how you have reacted to past treatment.<\/p>\n<p>The reason to have an advance directive is this: When you are hospitalized for a mental health condition or going through a crisis situation, you might get too sick to stay in charge of your treatment. At those times, doctors and other people may make decisions about your care and treatment that you do not want.<\/p>\n<p>You need someone else to make decisions for you, but only until the mental health crisis is over.\u00a0The advance directive is a temporary directive. It doesn\u2019t mean you give up control forever.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to create an advanced directive is to work with your current support person and think about how you would like to receive treatment.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mhanational.org\/creating-psychiatric-advance-directive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to follow 4 steps for creating a PAD<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The worksheet below is <strong>not a legally binding PAD<\/strong>, but it walks you through the steps of creating one.
