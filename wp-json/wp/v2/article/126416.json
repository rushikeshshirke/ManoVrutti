This is one of the hardest things about recovery. It\u2019s hard to talk about because when it\u2019s your children, the pain is magnified. It hurts to hurt them. But they want you to acknowledge it. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-tell-someone-i-have-a-problem-with-drugs-or-alcohol\/?layout=actions_e&amp;pathway=85623\">Sit down and talk to them about it.<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For myself, my son stopped believing in me, he lost trust, it took quite some time to get his trust back\u2026this really hits home for the way I treated my son. Now we have a good relationship, and we talk about it, and he understands.<\/p>\n<footer>Patricia, Virginia<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>You have to be honest<\/h2>\n<p>Help your children to understand that drinking or using a lot becomes an obsession of the mind. It changes your brain and becomes an <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-addiction\/?layout=actions_e&amp;pathway=85618\">addiction<\/a>. You cannot stop or control it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s like you deciding that you are not going to eat for five days. Your body will begin to crave food so much that it becomes overwhelming. You feel like you must have something to eat. This is the same for drinking or using\u2014 the obsession becomes overwhelming. You intend to stop, but you are not able to stop on your own.<\/p>\n<h2>It takes time to reconnect<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>I feel like when there\u2019s that drama in their childhood, it\u2019s not fixable, but you can work with it\u2026it takes time, and consistency, they want to see a consistent parent.<\/p>\n<footer>Robin, California<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It takes time to get into recovery and stop drinking and using. When you tell your children that you will stop drinking or using, you have the best intentions, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/why-cant-i-stop-using-drugs-or-alcohol\/?layout=actions_e\">but you are unable to stop.<\/a> Because of the nature of addiction, relapse, and recovery, your children are likely to feel that they cannot trust you.<\/p>\n<p>It is not your fault. If you could stop on your own, you would have done that. No one sets out to have problems with addiction. It happens and gets worse the more you drink and use. Trying to stop over and over makes you more upset. Your children see you are struggling. They realize you cannot control it.<\/p>\n<p>Your children not trusting you causes pain. You suffer because of it. The important thing is to remember it is a part of recovery. It helps you to see how your actions and behaviors impact other people\u2014especially the people that love you the most.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that as your children grow up, they begin to realize you are not perfect. They start questioning your beliefs, choices, and behavior. This is a part of growing up. There is no such thing as a perfect parent.<\/p>\n<h2>Accept there will always be trauma<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>My child had trauma therapy for some of the things I did. I have a couple of decades now, but my child still worries and says, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get sick again.\u201d<\/p>\n<footer>Bill, Georgia<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>About 25 percent of American kids grow up in households where there is substance abuse.[1] It might be helpful for you to step back and think about what it\u2019s like to grow up that way. A parent <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/if-i-drink-lot-does-make-me-alcoholic\/?layout=actions_e&amp;pathway=85618\">drinks a lot<\/a>. They get drunk. They get angry. They throw dishes in the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p><em>What does this do?<\/em> The child becomes <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/trauma-ptsd\/\">traumatized<\/a>. They feel embarrassed. They\u2019re afraid to bring friends over. Later in life, the children may continue to struggle. Become an <a href=\"https:\/\/adultchildren.org\/\">adult child of an alcoholic<\/a>. They might have trust issues and feelings of <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/diy\/overcoming-negative-thoughts\/\">negative self-worth<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-therapist\/?layout=actions_e\">need therapy<\/a>. Your child learning to trust you again and rebuild a connection with you takes time. You need to be in <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/get-help\/?_area_served=national&amp;_conditions=addiction\">recovery<\/a>. You also need to get involved in your child\u2019s life and be honest about your struggles.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tools and resources that can help your children find support:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/al-anon.org\/\">Al-Anon<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/pi\/about\/publications\/caregivers\/practice-settings\/intervention\/community-reinforcement\">Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT)<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/coda.org\/\">Co-dependent Anonymous<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/adultchildren.org\/\">Adult Children of Alcoholic &amp; Dysfunctional Families<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How relationships help us heal<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>For me this is a huge issue. I have two kids\u2026it\u2019s a huge process in recovery called asking for amends or forgiveness\u2026there will always be scars\u2026they are worried about relapse.<\/p>\n<footer>Robin, California<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Children can play a vital role in helping you get into recovery. They can help you to see your problem. Your children can take on a parent role. They can help take care of you while you get better. They can become your <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/who-makes-mental-health-decisions-me-if-i-cant\/?layout=actions_e&amp;pathway=85623\">healthcare agent<\/a>. They can help you not feel so much shame. Your experience may help your children see the dangers of alcohol and substance abuse.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-make-amends\/\">Ask your children for forgiveness\u2013but don\u2019t do it alone<\/a>. Trying to ask for forgiveness on your own can be frustrating and can make things worse. Talk to a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-therapist\/?layout=actions_e\">therapist<\/a>, sponsor, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-does-peer-support-look-like\/\">peer supporter,<\/a> or someone that can guide you through the process. Get them to help you with what to say and when to say it and practice it.<\/p>\n<p>You want to ask for forgiveness just once. If you keep asking them over and over, it loses its power. It can make your children mistrust you more. Remember making amends is about you. It helps you to overcome resentment. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-tell-someone-i-have-a-problem-with-drugs-or-alcohol\/?layout=actions_e&amp;pathway=85623\">Your children will begin to trust you when you admit your problems.<\/a>\u00a0 And if you <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-happens-if-i-relapse\/?layout=actions_e&amp;pathway=85623\">relapse<\/a>, get right back into <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/get-help\/?_area_served=national&amp;_conditions=addiction\">recovery<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Your children not trusting you can be the thing that helps you get into and stay in recovery.
