Maybe you are starting to worry about your family\u2019s drinking habits. Or you\u2019re afraid they could get into trouble with the law, but you feel pressure because it might make you feel closer to people. You may <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-tell-my-parents-their-drinking-or-using-makes-me-feel-unsafe\/\">be scared about how your parents act when they drink<\/a>, and you\u2019re uncomfortable being around that.\u00a0 If you know friends who drink with their parents, you probably want to know if it\u2019s okay or safe.\u00a0 All these questions are totally valid, and it\u2019s okay to ask them.<em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>How drinking can affect you<\/h2>\n<p>Alcohol use can have serious consequences in the short and long term on you.\u00a0 Drinking has a way of ruining your health and putting you in danger. The risks are higher when you drink at an earlier age.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some facts you may not know about drinking and how it affects brain development and function:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drinking can lead to brain damage and memory loss, including poor school performance.[1]<\/li>\n<li>Alcohol is a neurotoxin that interferes with the brain\u2019s communication pathways and functions. [2]<\/li>\n<li>Over time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain cells to die and a person&#8217;s brain tissue to shrink. [3]<\/li>\n<li>Increased risk of accidents, injury, and death while drunk is a clear and present danger when it comes to alcohol abuse. [4]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With so many warning signs about drinking, you\u2019ve got to be asking yourself if it\u2019s worth the serious risks.\u00a0 How important is alcohol in your life and do you need it to have a good time?\u00a0Drinking is not the best thing to do at a young age.\u00a0If you are worried about your own drinking, it may be a good idea to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/addiction\/\">take an addiction test.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s your parent\u2019s relationship with drinking?<\/h2>\n<p>Life comes at people hard, and some parents and families use alcohol to cope. In general, it\u2019s important to think about your parents\u2019 relationships with alcohol, even though that\u2019s difficult. But you can start by asking yourself:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Are my parents drinking to cope with the stress of their job, home, or daily life?<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Do my parents know the difference between drinking in moderation and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/addiction\/\">addiction<\/a>?<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Are there others in my family besides my parents who have alcohol or substance use disorders?<\/em><\/li>\n<li>\u00a0<em>How do I feel when my parents drink around me?<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Their drinking is not a reflection on you or your relationship with them. Remember, parents aren\u2019t perfect. They make mistakes, and so do their parents.\u00a0 They may have grown up with bad information that makes excuses for drinking.\u00a0 And for them, drinking is a survival skill that helps them deal with their emotions.<\/p>\n<p>But it is possible to replace drinking with healthier coping skills. If your parents don\u2019t have a healthy relationship with alcohol, then it\u2019s probably not a good idea to drink with them. If no one around you has good coping skills, then it can be very hard to create your own.<\/p>\n<p>Parents wanting to party with their kids is risky. Having this kind of early exposure to casual drinking makes it more likely that you can have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. You might also start to see how drinking is problematic for your family and that alcohol misuse or addiction might run in your family. It can make home life unpredictable when mood changes or poor decisions can be destabilizing and very tough on your life.<\/p>\n<p>When thinking about drinking with your parents, it might be good to reflect on: <em>\u201cAre they trying to be my friend or my parent?<\/em><em> Or \u201cHow is drinking affecting me?<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s okay to say no<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>Refuse to inherit dysfunction.\u00a0 Learn new ways of living instead of repeating what you lived through.<\/p>\n<footer>T, CA<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The bottom line is that you need to be your own person, break free from your parents, and have your own life.\u00a0 When it comes right down to it, choosing not to drink is your choice.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying no or not participating.<\/p>\n<p>Going to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-therapist\/\">family or individual counseling<\/a> can help you identify dysfunctional family patterns.\u00a0 It will also give you a set of tools to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-set-boundaries-my-family\/\">create boundaries<\/a> and allow you to rise out of a bad situation or bad habits.\u00a0 Organizations such as <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/al-anon\/\">Al-Anon<\/a> will help you find volunteer-led group therapy for friends and family of alcoholics.\u00a0 Take a look at the article \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/my-family-dysfunctional\/\">Is my family dysfunctional?<\/a>\u201d\u00a0 It points you to signs you should look for, how it affects you, and how to deal with family dysfunction.
