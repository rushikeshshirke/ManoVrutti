If you\u2019re like us, it\u2019s probably been a while.<\/p>\n<p>Journaling is one of those go-to prescriptions for improving your mental health that you know is probably a good idea, but you\u2019ve always found a reason to avoid it.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s always a reason to <em>not<\/em> do something. Let\u2019s calm your hesitations with some quick and easy reasons to give journaling a try.<\/p>\n<h2>It clears your mind, and it saves you time.<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, it takes time, but as you write, you\u2019re detoxing your mind of all the frustrations from the past and releasing the anxieties of things in the future. Actively engaging with those thoughts and letting them go can cause your unfocused mind to be present afterward. It can help you save time throughout your day.<\/p>\n<p>You may imagine journaling being something that takes up a ton of your time, but you can do a quick five-minute journal entry in the morning as your coffee is brewing, or even just three minutes right before you head to sleep. You\u2019re still helping yourself \u2013 no matter how much time you invest.<\/p>\n<h2>You have so much to gain.<\/h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s say you fill up pages and pages of a journal, and you don\u2019t feel any different. Don\u2019t sweat it \u2013 you may already be benefiting in a way that isn\u2019t obvious. Research shows that journaling will:<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>Help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518\">achieve goals<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Boost your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518\">memory<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Improve <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1207\/S15324796ABM2403_10\">emotional intelligence<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Strengthen <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3102\/00346543066001053\">communication skills<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Help you <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/14623730.2010.9721810\">work through anxiety and stress<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It can be hard to notice anything changing or getting better, but trust that by taking a few minutes each day, you\u2019re improving your mental health. You\u2019ll never know if it works for you until you give it a try.<\/p>\n<h2>It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.<\/h2>\n<p>Does the idea of journaling send you back to an English class \u2014 and not in a good way? Maybe your handwriting isn\u2019t flawless, your grammar isn\u2019t perfect, or your sentences aren\u2019t beautifully written.<em> All of that is ok!<\/em> Remember, you aren\u2019t turning it in for a grade.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to forget that this journal is solely for you. If you want to write with bullet points, do that. If you want to draw a picture, do that. This journal is your own private space to let everything go. Don\u2019t let the fear of writing stop you from learning so much about yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>There\u2019s so much to write about.<\/h2>\n<p>When you have something on your mind, you have something to write about. Your journal doesn\u2019t have to be a diary filled with pages of all the exciting things you\u2019re doing. Just be yourself, and write out all of the things going on in your head: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Your thoughts are important and worth writing out.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel stuck, try putting your pen to paper and writing out every thought going through your head. You can even write, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to write. Blah, blah, blah, this pen is blue\u2026\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be a narrative or even coherent sentences. Once you get started, it gets easier to write and you\u2019ll get into a groove. Just write!<\/p>\n<h2>You can stick with it.<\/h2>\n<p>As with anything, the more you journal the better you\u2019ll get at it \u2014 and the better you\u2019ll feel. But it\u2019s not like you have to journal every single day for three months to really see and feel the benefits. Even if you only write in your journal a few times a week, once a week, or even once a month, you\u2019re still starting a journaling routine.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say that you start out strong and are journaling every morning, but slowly you start feeling less motivated. Take some time to read back through what you\u2019ve written. You may be surprised at the changes in your writing. And it could give you some inspiration to stick with it!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to say \u201cjournaling isn&#8217;t for me\u201d, but it could be what you\u2019ve always been missing in your self-care routine. You just have to try! And you never know\u2026 journaling may become one of your favorite parts of the day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When was the last time that you picked up a pen and paper and wrote something longer than a to-do list?
