It\u2019s supposed to be fun and positive. But if you\u2019re having too much of a good thing, it can feel like it\u2019s taking over your life!<\/p>\n<h2>Is it normal to have this much sex?<\/h2>\n<p>Sex is very personal. Your \u201cnormal\u201d might be different from someone else\u2019s. The average adult has sex about once a week [1], but it\u2019s fine to have more\u2014or less\u2014as long as it works for you.<\/p>\n<p>There are certain times when you might have a lot more sex than usual. If your sex drive suddenly goes through the roof, it can catch you off guard. But there are lots of things that affect your sex drive:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle changes: <\/strong>Eating right, exercising, and getting enough sleep can all increase your sex drive.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age: <\/strong>Your sex drive can go up and down over your lifespan.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Medications or recreational drugs:<\/strong> Many drugs\u2014legal and illegal\u2014can affect your sex drive. If you recently started or stopped taking something, or changed your dosage, it might be the culprit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your relationship status:<\/strong> It\u2019s common to have lots of sex when you start a new relationship. Or, maybe you <em>just<\/em> left a relationship where the sex wasn\u2019t great, and now you\u2019re making up for lost time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mental health: <\/strong>Stress can kill your sex drive\u2026 or it can make you want to have sex all the time as a coping mechanism. Some mental illnesses have a unique effect on your sex drive. For example, people with <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-bipolar\/\">bipolar disorder<\/a> often have more sex than usual <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-mania\/\">during a manic episode<\/a>. Sex can also be a person&#8217;s go-to coping skill for things like depression and anxiety. If you think a mental health condition might be involved, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">take one of our mental health tests<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There\u2019s also a lot of variation in who people have sex with [2]. It\u2019s normal to experiment with your sexuality.<\/p>\n<p>Different cultures and religions have their own beliefs about what\u2019s acceptable or moral. If your sexual behavior doesn\u2019t line up with those expectations, you might feel guilty and think you have a problem. In those situations, you need to ask yourself what needs to change: your sexual behavior, or your beliefs about sex? Either one is fine, but don\u2019t let other people control how you feel about your sexuality.<\/p>\n<p>Things like non-monogamy and polyamory are also becoming more socially acceptable. These types of relationships can absolutely be healthy and consensual. But we&#8217;re not saying it&#8217;s okay to cheat on someone. When you step outside the boundaries you and your partner have defined for your relationship, you&#8217;re violating their trust. Cheating is fairly common among both men and women, but it&#8217;s also usually just one of many problems in a relationship.<\/p>\n<h2>When does my sexual behavior become a mental health issue?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not so much about how much sex you\u2019re having, or who you\u2019re having it with\u2014it\u2019s about <em>how it\u2019s affecting your life<\/em>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is sex taking up so much of your time that it\u2019s hard for you to complete your responsibilities?<\/li>\n<li>Is your sexual activity out of line with your values?<\/li>\n<li>Are you having <a href=\"https:\/\/www.plannedparenthood.org\/learn\/stds-hiv-safer-sex\/safer-sex\">unsafe sex<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>Are you hurting someone else by cheating on them or by pressuring them to do sexual things they&#8217;re not comfortable with?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the answer to any of these is \u201cyes,\u201d it might be time to think about changing your sexual behavior. This could mean doing things differently, or cutting back on the amount of sex you&#8217;re having. If you\u2019ve already tried cutting back and you can\u2019t, there\u2019s a possibility you could be addicted to sex. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-you-be-addicted-behavior\/\">Take a look at the definition of behavioral addictions<\/a> and see if it describes your sex life.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re addicted to sex, or you just feel uncomfortable with your sex life in some way, it\u2019s helpful to find someone you can talk to about it. Your family doctor, a local sexual health clinic, or a therapist who specializes in sexuality are great places to start.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Twenge et al.
