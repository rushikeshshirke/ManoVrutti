Fortunately, the big goal of stopping your alcohol use can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps.<\/p>\n<h2>Manage withdrawal symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>This will be your first hurdle. Any time you cut back on a habit-forming substance such as alcohol, your body goes through\u00a0<strong>withdrawals<\/strong>. Your body has gotten used to the amount you\u2019ve been drinking, so cutting back throws your body out of balance. This effect is temporary, but <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/is-it-safe-to-stop-drinking-by-myself\/\">it can be miserable\u2014and in rare cases, even dangerous<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The most common symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include anxiety, nausea and vomiting, headaches, inability to sleep, sweating, and shaking. Some people even experience seizures and hallucinations. The more heavily you\u2019ve been drinking, and the more quickly you stop, the more intense the symptoms will be.<\/p>\n<p>Start by talking to a doctor, who can give you recommendations based on your unique biology and situation. There are also medications that can make it easier to quit drinking. If you\u2019ve been drinking heavily, try to decrease the amount of alcohol you drink gradually instead of quitting cold turkey.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn your triggers<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Triggers<\/strong> are things that remind you of alcohol and make you crave it. Common triggers include bars, friends you\u2019ve drank with in the past, or anything else that brings up memories of drinking. You can also experience <em>emotional<\/em> triggers, like depression or anger. Everyone\u2019s triggers are different. You\u2019ll need to learn your own.<\/p>\n<p>Early in the process, it\u2019s best to avoid your triggers as much as possible\u2014especially while you\u2019re still in withdrawal. There may be some triggers you can\u2019t avoid forever, and you\u2019ll eventually need to learn coping skills to face them.<\/p>\n<h2>Address any underlying mental health needs<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40429-015-0076-5\">More than half of people who are addicted to alcohol also have another mental health condition<\/a>. In fact, many people start drinking as a way of self-medicating for an underlying mental illness. Addressing your mental health needs can make it much easier to quit drinking. If you haven\u2019t yet, take one of our mental health screens to see if you are at risk for a mental illness.<\/p>\n<h2>Long-term recovery<\/h2>\n<p>Many people are able to get sober for a few months, but then go back to drinking. This is called <strong>relapse<\/strong>. If this happens to you, that\u2019s okay. For many people, relapse is a part of recovery\u2014each time you relapse, you learn more about your triggers, and which coping skills aren\u2019t working for you. The important thing is to keep trying.<\/p>\n<h2>Find help and support<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to quit drinking on your own. Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to! Supportive family and friends can be a great resource in recovery from alcohol use. There are also many quality treatment programs around the country who can help you through the steps we\u2019ve laid out here. Many people find help through support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or SMART Recovery.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re reading this, alcohol is probably a big part of your life\u2014and it\u2019s starting to take over.
