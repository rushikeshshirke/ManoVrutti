But\u00a0accommodations for mental health conditions can be just as important for employees to perform to the best of their ability at work.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/askjan.org\/\">Job Accommodation Network<\/a> (JAN) is the leading source of free, expert, and confidential guidance on workplace accommodations and disability employment issues. Staff at JAN offers one-on-one guidance on workplace accommodations, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and related laws, and self-employment and entrepreneurship options for people with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p>According to JAN, the following is a list of common accommodations that you can request to help you manage your mental illness and job responsibilities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flexible Schedule<\/li>\n<li>Modified Break Schedule<\/li>\n<li>Rest Area\/Private Space<\/li>\n<li>Support Animal<\/li>\n<li>Support Person<\/li>\n<li>Identify and Reduce Triggers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want to research accommodation options yourself, you can call JAN to get accommodation ideas or look at JAN\u2019s on-line accommodation publications at <a href=\"https:\/\/askjan.org\/a-to-z.cfm\">JAN&#8217;s A to Z<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When requesting an accommodation, JAN recommends documenting a written request by completing an <a href=\"https:\/\/askjan.org\/media\/accommrequestltr.cfm\">accommodation request letter<\/a>. You should consider the following items to include when drafting the letter:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify yourself as a person with a disability<\/li>\n<li>State that you are requesting accommodations under the ADA (or the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 if you are a federal employee)<\/li>\n<li>Identify your specific problematic job tasks<\/li>\n<li>Identify your accommodation ideas<\/li>\n<li>Request your employer&#8217;s accommodation ideas<\/li>\n<li>Refer to attached medical documentation if appropriate<\/li>\n<li>Ask that your employer respond to your request in a reasonable amount of time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A request for accommodations should be processed in a quick and timely manner by management or HR to be in compliance with the ADA; however, you might consider following up with your supervisor or HR directly to check in with the processing of your request and further document the interaction.<\/p>\n<h2>Resources<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/askjan.org\/media\/accommrequestltr.cfm\">Sample Accommodation Request Letter<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/askjan.org\/publications\/consultants-corner\/Employee-Accommodation-Inquiry-Letter.cfm\">Follow-up Email Template<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If symptoms of a mental health or substance use condition are impacting your ability to perform at work, it may be time to have a conversation with your supervisor or human resources (HR) department about reasonable accommodations.
