It often takes time to realize you are experiencing mental illness in the first place\u2014and even more time to feel ready to seek treatment. Taking the first steps to get better is really brave. But it can be really discouraging when you start a treatment\u2026 only to discover that it\u2019s actually making you feel worse!<\/p>\n<p>First off, know that this isn\u2019t unusual. Many people experience side effects from their medications. It\u2019s also not the end of the road\u2014when you know what <em>doesn\u2019t<\/em> work, you\u2019re one step closer to finding what <em>does<\/em> work. It\u2019s all part of the recovery process.<\/p>\n<h2>Side-effects<\/h2>\n<p>Most medications have side effects for at least some people. Some are really serious, and others are simply strange or annoying. Everyone\u2019s body is different: not everyone experiences every side effect to the same degree. Some people might not notice any at all.<\/p>\n<p>Each medication will have different side effects, but some common ones include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sleeping too much or not at all<\/li>\n<li>Vivid dreams or nightmares<\/li>\n<li>Becoming irritable or aggressive<\/li>\n<li>Being unable to sit still<\/li>\n<li>Decreased sex drive<\/li>\n<li>Nausea, constipation, or diarrhea<\/li>\n<li>Gaining or losing weight<\/li>\n<li>Feeling the opposite of how the medication is supposed to make you feel\u2014like feeling more depressed when you take an antidepressant, or more anxious when you take an anti-anxiety med. <strong>If a medication makes you feel suicidal, tell your doctor right away.<\/strong> You can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"http:\/\/988lifeline.org\/\">988lifeline.org<\/a>. You can also <a href=\"sms:+1-741-741;?&amp;body=MHA\">text &#8220;MHA&#8221; to 741-741<\/a> to reach the Crisis Text Line.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When a doctor prescribes a medication, they consider the possible side effects as well as the positive effects of the medication. If they think the benefits outweigh the risks, they\u2019ll prescribe the medication. Doctors generally know a lot about how medications affect <em>most people<\/em>\u2014but your experience might be different. If you don\u2019t like the way a medication makes you feel, talk to your doctor about other options.<\/p>\n<h2>Dealing with side-effects<\/h2>\n<p>Some side effects can be serious. Your doctor should warn you of serious side effects when they prescribe a medication. They\u2019ll usually tell you to stop taking a medication immediately if you experience any of these.<\/p>\n<p>Less serious side effects sometimes go away on your own. If you\u2019re experiencing something that is unpleasant but bearable, it might be worth powering through the first few weeks to see if it gets better. Still, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor as soon as possible to make sure it isn\u2019t a sign of something more serious.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes your doctor might prescribe a second medication to counteract the side effects of the first one. This might seem like a lot\u2014if you don\u2019t like the idea of being on so many medications, your doctor should take that into account. But many people take multiple meds for their mental health and do just fine, so it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.<\/p>\n<p>If the side effects are completely unbearable and they don\u2019t go away with time, you can talk to your doctor about other options. They may switch you to a different medication, or recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-mental-illness\/\">another type of treatment<\/a> entirely. (If you\u2019re not already doing it, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-to-expect\/\">therapy is another great way to improve your mental health<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to stop taking a medication you\u2019ve been taking for a while, don\u2019t stop all at once\u2014this can make the side effects worse! Instead, gradually decrease the dose. If the medication comes in a tablet, you can do this just by breaking them in half. Otherwise, your doctor can give you smaller pills so you can taper off over the course of a few weeks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seeking treatment for mental illness can be hard.
