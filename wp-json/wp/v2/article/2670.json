Finding providers that align with your identity can be even more daunting.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even after navigating barriers to care, QTBIPOC are often still met with therapists that may not have the experience or training to make them culturally responsive and\/or LGBTQ-inclusive. We\u2019ve compiled some tips below in the form of questions that you can ask that may help with this \u2014 think of it as a therapist interview. Our hope is that asking these questions can eliminate potential stress and even save you time and money from unsuccessful therapist matches.<\/p>\n<p><em>For mental health provider directories and search engines visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrc.org\/resources\/qtbipoc-mental-health-and-well-being\">HRC.im\/Help<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"btn-download\"><a href=\"https:\/\/assets2.hrc.org\/files\/assets\/resources\/BIPOC_Inclusive_Therapist_Questions_073020.pdf?_ga=2.117698831.765552520.1596142780-1787279304.1532711558\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download printable version<\/a><\/div>\n<p><object class=\"embedded-pdf\" title=\"Embedded PDF version of the worksheet entitled 'Questions to help QTBIPOC find affirming mental health providers'.\" data=\"https:\/\/assets2.hrc.org\/files\/assets\/resources\/BIPOC_Inclusive_Therapist_Questions_073020.pdf?_ga=2.117698831.765552520.1596142780-1787279304.1532711558#view=FitH\" type=\"application\/pdf\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\">\u00a0<\/object><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a web-friendly version of the questions from the worksheet:<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Quick notes:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The questions listed below are meant to offer you suggestions to choose from; consider selecting between three and six options that resonate with you the most. When you reach out to a therapist, request a 15-20 minute \u201cinterview\u201d to ask these questions, or you can send them via email. Remember that it\u2019s normal to have some fear\/anxiety around asking these questions and\/or anticipating the response; keep this in mind when considering whether to ask these questions in-person or via email.<\/li>\n<li>We recommend inserting your own LGBTQ and racial\/cultural identities in the spaces indicated below to help ensure the provider understands your specific identity and is able to distinguish your experiences from the broader QTBIPOC community.<\/li>\n<li>Most of the language suggested in these questions includes terminology commonly used in our communities, and that is intentional. A provider\u2019s level of knowledge and comfort responding to terms they may not be familiar with is something that may help you determine whether they are the right fit.<\/li>\n<li>While some of the questions in the LGBTQ inclusion and racial\/cultural responsiveness sections are similar, they are listed separately in an effort to limit the instances of a provider not responding fully to the question or overgeneralizing their response.<\/li>\n<li>Encourage the provider to be as specific as possible in their descriptions of knowledge and experience (i.e. I\u2019ve treated many clients who\u2019ve shared your identity, I\u2019ve treated some, I\u2019m not sure I ever have, I have very little experience, or I have no experience).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Questions around LGBTQ
