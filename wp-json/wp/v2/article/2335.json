Even for those who experience serious side effects, they may decide\u2014just like with any other type of medicine or medical procedure\u2014that the risks and side effects are worth the benefits. Some choose to stay on medication when they are feeling ok to lessen the likelihood and intensity of future episodes of mania, hypomania, or depression.<\/p>\n<p>Other people use medication for short periods of time. These are individuals who may not want to be on medication all the time, and may work with their doctors to adjust their medications based on what is happening in their lives. People may have years go by where they take no medications at all.<\/p>\n<p>Some people choose to not take medications at all.
