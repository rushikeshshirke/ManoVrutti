If something about their words or behavior makes you think they might be struggling with mental illness, it can put you in an awkward situation. You care about them, but you don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable. What can you do?<\/p>\n<h2>What are they saying or doing that\u2019s concerning to you?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to jump to conclusions about which mental illness they might be experiencing. The problem is, you don\u2019t really know for sure. You\u2019re probably not a doctor or a therapist\u2014and even if you are, you\u2019re too close to the situation to diagnose a friend or family member.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, focus on the words and behaviors that you\u2019re concerned about. Say something like, \u201cHey\u2014when you said you wished you were dead\u2026 It just made me wonder if you\u2019re okay. Do you really feel that way?\u201d Or, \u201cHey, I noticed you\u2019ve been missing class a lot lately. I wanted to check in and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By focusing on their words and behaviors, you avoid labeling the other person. The focus is on <em>your<\/em> observations, and <em>your<\/em> feelings about them. That\u2019s easier for another person to accept. It helps them trust you not to be judgmental if they decide to open up.<\/p>\n<p>It may turn out that they don\u2019t actually have a diagnosable mental illness. That doesn\u2019t mean your concerns aren\u2019t valid. Not everyone has a mental illness\u2014but everyone <em>does<\/em> have mental health. And everyone\u2019s mental health can improve.<\/p>\n<h2>Be supportive and encouraging<\/h2>\n<p>If they choose to open up to you, your first job is just to be there for them and listen. What they tell you may be uncomfortable or even scary. But by listening to it without judgment, you\u2019re letting them know that it\u2019s okay to feel that way\u2014and it\u2019s also okay to ask for help.<\/p>\n<p>When it feels like they\u2019re ready, it\u2019s okay to make suggestions about seeking help. If they\u2019re receptive to it, talking to a doctor or a therapist is a great place to start. They\u2019ll either be able to diagnose them, or find refer them to someone who can. (If your loved one is resistant to seeing a professional, an easier ask is for them to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\">take a free online mental health test<\/a>. It\u2019s not a diagnosis, but it\u2019s a starting point to get them used to the idea.)<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to make suggestions\u2014not demands. Explain to them why you think seeking a particular kind of help would be helpful for them. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-help-loved-one-mental-illness\">Be supportive, too<\/a>: offer to go with them to their first appointment, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/vetting-online-resources\">look up information about mental health together<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Do what you can. Accept what you can\u2019t.<\/h2>\n<p>They might not want to listen to your concerns. They may stay in denial about having a mental illness. They may refuse to seek treatment. Your instinct at this point might be to try and \u201csave\u201d them\u2014to swoop in and take over. Most of the time, that\u2019s going to backfire. Mental health treatments work best with the person receiving them is on board. And being too pushy can close them off to your help in the future. Let them follow their own path, even if they make choices along the way that frustrate you.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if their behavior is affecting you, you have a responsibility to take care of yourself as well. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-do-when-they-dont-want-help\">If the other person refuses to seek help<\/a> and their behavior continues to negatively impact you or your relationship, it\u2019s okay to set boundaries and take a step back. And <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/my-family-member-refuses-go-hospital\">if their behavior is putting them or someone else in danger, it\u2019s okay to be a bit more forceful<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s hard to bring up concerns about someone else\u2019s mental health.
