These often go years without being diagnosed. If you can\u2019t figure out why you\u2019re so exhausted, it\u2019s a good idea to ask a doctor to run some tests.<\/p>\n<p>Your energy level is also affected by your mental health. Chronic exhaustion is a symptom of depression\u2014and so is beating yourself up, using negative labels like \u201clazy.\u201d Anxiety can also wear you down. Your brain uses a <em>lot<\/em> of energy, and if you\u2019re worrying all the time, it will use up even more! <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">Take one of our mental health tests<\/a> to find out if a mental health condition might be holding you back.<\/p>\n<h2>What is your brain trying to tell you?<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes it can feel like our emotions are getting in our way. Depression and anxiety can feel like \u201cthe enemy.\u201d But a lot of the time, they\u2019re trying to tell us something important. Maybe the message is that you\u2019re full of self-doubt\u2014you just don\u2019t believe you can accomplish what you\u2019re trying to do, so why bother? Maybe what you\u2019re trying to do is just not really that important to you. Maybe it\u2019s someone else\u2019s goal and you\u2019re just going through the motions. Or maybe you need to work smarter, not harder: take a step back and see if there\u2019s an easier way to accomplish your goals.<\/p>\n<p>If you take the time to pay attention to your mind and body, you might be able to figure out what changes you can make to feel more motivated to achieve your goals.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting motivated<\/h2>\n<p>All of this doesn\u2019t mean that getting motivated isn\u2019t a challenge. Change is hard, and working up the courage to accomplish something difficult takes some work. Just by looking up information on what to do, you&#8217;ve taken the first step. Now let&#8217;s get into some tips!<\/p>\n<p>Think about the goals you\u2019ve set that you feel unmotivated to work on. Ask yourself some questions to get to the heart of <em>why<\/em> you want to accomplish them. Writing down the answers can help too\u2014fill in the blanks with the goal you\u2019re focused on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is ______ so important to me?<\/li>\n<li>How would my life be different if I could ______?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s getting in the way of ______?<\/li>\n<li>On a scale of 1-10, how motivated do I feel to ______?<\/li>\n<li>What would it take for me to get one number higher on that scale? (from a 3 to a 4, for example)<\/li>\n<li>What is the easiest, smallest thing I can do now to move just a little bit closer to ______?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These questions do a couple of things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>They get you thinking about the reasons why you want to change.<\/strong> Or, they may uncover that you don\u2019t really have any reasons to change. That\u2019s okay too! It means it might be time to reevaluate your goals, or to start thinking about them differently.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They help you identify obstacles.<\/strong> There are always things holding us back from our goals. Remove some of those roadblocks, and it will be easier to move forward.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They help you break down big goals into small steps. <\/strong>You\u2019ve probably heard a million times that \u201cit\u2019s not the destination that counts\u2014it\u2019s the journey.\u201d Even if the destination is what you care the most about, the journey is what gets you there. The important thing is taking small steps toward your goals. Small wins will build up your confidence and help you start to see your progress, which makes the rest of the journey seem a lot more appealing!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unmotivated or just tired?
