There are lots of things you can do on your own!<\/p>\n<h2>Learn all you can about bipolar disorder.<\/h2>\n<p>You can find lots of great information online, on this site and many others. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/bipolar\">Read all you can about bipolar disorder<\/a>\u2014what it is and how it works. The better you understand it, the more you will be able to manage its symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>It also helps to find stories about people who have lived with bipolar disorder. You can read blog posts or memoirs, watch videos, or visit forums like Reddit or other <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/depression-and-bipolar-support-alliance\">online communities<\/a>. Hearing about other people\u2019s experiences will help you feel less alone, identify exactly what\u2019s going on, and get good ideas about what might work for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn all you can about yourself!<\/h2>\n<p>Your mental health is intertwined with your thoughts, feelings, and actions. It\u2019s a part of who you are, and it\u2019s hard to work on your mental health without learning more about yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You might feel like you already know yourself pretty well, but we all have things we\u2019re unaware of\u2014or are too uncomfortable to admit. Here are some ways to get to know yourself better:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Track your moods.<\/strong> Once a day, just write down how you\u2019re feeling. If you can identify what made you feel that way, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-keep-mental-health-journal\/\">write that down too<\/a>. After a while you\u2019ll be able to identify patterns. Maybe depression hits you harder on cloudy days\u2026 or maybe not getting enough sleep triggers a manic episode. The more you can predict your moods, the less they can take you by surprise\u2014and the better you can cope with them. Be sure to do this when you\u2019re feeling manic too, not just when you\u2019re depressed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pay attention to your thinking.<\/strong> Your thoughts influence your feelings, which influence your behaviors. Be on the lookout for <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/thinking-traps-how-can-i-deal-with-negative-thoughts\/\">negative self-talk<\/a> and irrational beliefs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Identify your coping skills.<\/strong> We all have different ways of coping with our emotions. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-stop-stress-eating\/\">Do you stress eat?<\/a> Do you drink when you\u2019re upset? Do you go for a run, play video games, listen to music, or call a friend? These are all coping skills, and they all have pros and cons. Try not to label your coping skills as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. Instead, think about how well they <em>work<\/em>\u2014short-term, and long-term.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get feedback from people you trust. <\/strong>When you\u2019re at your lowest point, you\u2019ll probably need support and encouragement more than anything. But once you\u2019re in a place where you can handle it, you\u2019ll also want to get some more constructive feedback. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/should-i-tell-someone-i-have-a-mental-illness\/\">Try to find people<\/a> who will deliver that feedback in a sensitive way\u2026 but be prepared to hear some things that might be uncomfortable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Make small changes over time<\/h2>\n<p>As you learn more about yourself, you\u2019ll probably notice some thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors you\u2019d like to change. Pick one or two to work on at a time, and start with really easy ones. Once you\u2019ve made progress on these, you\u2019ll start feeling more confident, and eventually you\u2019ll be able to tackle bigger things. If you try to make too many changes at once, you\u2019ll get overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep an open mind<\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019re deciding what kinds of things to try, keep an open mind about what might work. Sometimes the things you\u2019re most resistant to are things you could really benefit from!<\/p>\n<p>Revisit what you\u2019re trying every once in a while. Make a note of what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. As you grow as a person and your circumstances change, you may need to try different things to stay mentally healthy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Therapy and medication aren\u2019t the only ways to treat bipolar disorder.
