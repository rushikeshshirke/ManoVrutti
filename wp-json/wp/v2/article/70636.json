Especially when we go through situations like being hurt by people who are supposed to love us, experiencing chronic illnesses, struggling to succeed in work or school, or our relationships breaking up. All these experiences can make us feel like, \u201c<em>Maybe there\u2019s something wrong with ME<\/em>.\u201d And when we feel this way, we start to wonder: <em>Am I broken?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The problem with thoughts like these is that they can get us stuck. It makes problems feel like they\u2019ll never change, but this isn\u2019t true.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that you are hurting and may feel broken. BUT it&#8217;s in this moment. And this moment will not last forever. Things will get better because you are more than your traumatic experiences.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How we start to blame ourselves<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When we feel broken, we may begin to believe that something must be wrong with us while the rest of the world goes on with their lives. And we may start to blame ourselves, but why do we do this?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Our thoughts:<\/strong> When life beats you down over and over again, it\u2019s hard not to let thoughts become beliefs that make you feel \u201cstuck.\u201d Bad experiences might lead you to think, \u201c<em>Have I experienced things so damaging that I\u2019m broken? Or \u201cIs the problem me? Am I just broken and that\u2019s why it won\u2019t get better?<\/em> \u201d\u00a0 These thoughts change the way we see ourselves.\u00a0 And these thought problems are <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/thinking-traps-how-can-i-deal-with-negative-thoughts\/\">called thinking traps<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What we go through:<\/strong> Our life experiences can also make us feel broken. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-trauma\/\">Living through traumatic experiences<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/condition-forever-will-i-always-feel-way\/?pathway=16355\">living with a mental health condition<\/a> means that sometimes we put ourselves in situations where we are hurt again.\u00a0 For example, experiencing childhood trauma increases our risk of having interpersonal violence in relationships when we are teenagers or young adults.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Life in general:<\/strong> Being human means we experience difficult things in life often. But experiencing multiple traumas again and again means you are at greater risk of developing <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-depression-really-like\/\">depression<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-complex-ptsd\/\">complex PTSD<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But none of these things mean that we are broken. When we feel this way it\u2019s important to recognize that what has happened in the past (or present) doesn\u2019t mean that it has to determine your future. You may be going through a difficult time right now, but you will get through it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"layout-action show-actions_h\"><div class=\"diy-tool-shortcode embed-type-full\">\t\n<div

The cracks represent a permanent loss\u2026 but they also allow the dish to be more beautiful than it was before\u2014and a lot more <em>interesting<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>As part of rethinking your experiences, you might think of yourself as a vase. You may have been broken, but a broken vase put back together is still a vase. Even if it doesn\u2019t look quite the same as before, it still serves its original purpose. And in some ways, it may even be more unique, stronger, or special. This is a powerful analogy to remember when you feel broken.<\/p>\n<p>Even though you may have a few scars, you\u2019re still worthy and you matter. Given what you\u2019ve gone through, you\u2019re probably resilient, funny, and certainly more compassionate towards suffering.<\/p>\n<p>Though it might not seem like it now, our challenges make us who we are. Your experiences are the glue that holds the vase together. When you\u2019re deep in the trenches of feeling broken this might sound like nonsense, but it\u2019s true. Your past has made you stronger or helped you to grow in some way. While you may feel broken, you can always put yourself back together and rebuild.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">Taking one of our mental health tests<\/a> or exploring the links on this site to learn more can be a start for learning more about your mental health.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Life is hard.
