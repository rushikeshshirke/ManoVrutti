Though this is changing in many places, there still may be a stigma in some workplaces. And if you are not sure how your supervisor might react, talking to them can be scary.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not to disclose your mental illness is up to you but knowing your rights can help you make an informed decision. The important thing to remember is that no matter how scary, you still need to find the best way to support yourself on the job. This may include asking for reasonable accommodations or documenting instances of discrimination.<\/p>\n<h2>Knowing your rights<\/h2>\n<p>Many people feel uncomfortable telling their supervisors about their mental health conditions, and that\u2019s okay. But your employer can\u2019t be held accountable for what they don\u2019t know. For example, if you\u2019re having trouble making it to work on time because your anxiety makes it hard to get enough sleep, your employer may be more understanding than if they think you\u2019re just being lazy. If your mental illness starts interfering with your work, disclosing it may be a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), your employer is only allowed to ask questions about your mental health in four situations:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you ask for a reasonable accommodation<\/li>\n<li>After a job offer but before employment begins<\/li>\n<li>When the employer is engaging in affirmative action for people with disabilities<\/li>\n<li>On the job, when there is objective evidence that you may be unable to do your job or pose a safety risk because of your condition.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To receive protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you have to tell your employer that you have a mental illness. If you do talk to your employer, they cannot discriminate against you, including firing you, rejecting you for a job promotion, or forcing you to take leave. And they must keep the information confidential, including from coworkers.<\/p>\n<h2>Talking to human resources<\/h2>\n<p>Most mid-size to larger companies have a human resources (HR) representative that you can talk to instead of just telling your supervisor. HR representatives often have backgrounds in psychology and tend to be more empathetic. You also don\u2019t report to them for your daily job duties, making it less awkward. If you still need to talk to your supervisor about it, the HR representative can be with you to provide support while you do.<\/p>\n<h2>Reasonable accommodations<\/h2>\n<p>Telling your employer about your mental illness has another possible advantage: <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-mental-health-accommodations-can-i-ask-work\/\">you can ask for \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d<\/a> For example, maybe they can switch you to a later shift, so it\u2019s not so hard to get there on time. Or they may give you more flexibility with your work hours so that you can attend your doctor\u2019s appointments. Little things like this can go a long way in making your job more manageable.<\/p>\n<h2>Other considerations<\/h2>\n<p>If you decide to take the step and tell your supervisor about your mental illness, then there are a few things that you should be aware of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>You still need to be able to complete the essential duties of the job.<\/strong> The ADA can\u2019t protect you from things like being underqualified or from anything that\u2019s not directly related to your mental illness.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Not all accommodations are \u201creasonable.<\/strong>\u201d If you need too much help to complete your job duties, your employer can argue that the accommodations create an \u201cundue hardship\u201d for the company.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>If there are safety concerns, then you can still be let go<\/strong>. Your employer can let you go if your mental illness poses a direct threat to anyone\u2019s safety.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><strong>The ADA does not apply to all companies. <\/strong>If the company has fewer than 15 employees, the ADA does not apply.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0<strong>Your employer may ask for documentation of your mental illness.<\/strong> While <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">our mental health screens are a great starting point<\/a>, they don\u2019t count as a diagnosis. Only a qualified professional (usually a doctor or a therapist) can provide you with the documentation you need.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p>It\u2019s up to you to decide if you tell your supervisor about your mental illness. Tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/empower-work\/\">Empower Work<\/a> can connect you with a counselor to express your work-related challenges.
