But it can be hard to cut back\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-stop-drinking\/\">let alone stop drinking entirely<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Any time you cut back on a habit-forming substance such as alcohol, your body goes through <strong>withdrawals<\/strong>. Your body has adapted to the amount you\u2019ve been drinking, so cutting back throws your body out of balance. This effect is temporary. Once it\u2019s over, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the health effects of lower alcohol consumption.<\/p>\n<p>There are many symptoms of alcohol withdrawals. Not everyone will experience every symptom. The heavier your drinking, and the more quickly you stop, the more serious your symptoms will be. Some examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anxiety<\/li>\n<li>Nausea and vomiting<\/li>\n<li>Headaches<\/li>\n<li>Inability to sleep<\/li>\n<li>Sweating<\/li>\n<li>Shaking or seizures<\/li>\n<li>Hallucinations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You may have heard that <strong>alcohol withdrawals can kill you<\/strong>. That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s extremely rare. You can reduce your risk of experiencing serious withdrawal effects by cutting back on your alcohol use gradually, rather than quitting cold turkey.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to talk to a doctor before you stop drinking. Your doctor can give you personalized advice on how to stop drinking safely. There are also medications that can make it easier and safer to stop. If you have a really hard time quitting, you may benefit from an addiction treatment center, or a support group like Alcoholics Anonymous. At the very least, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-tell-someone-i-have-a-problem\/\">it\u2019s a good idea to tell your loved ones that you are planning to stop drinking<\/a> and ask for their support. It\u2019s hard to quit drinking on your own\u2014but <a href=\"\/connect\">with the right support system<\/a>, you won\u2019t have to.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ul>\n<li>A.D.A.M.
