And a lot of people have found strength in sharing their stories on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Most people find an overwhelmingly positive response when they share. But occasionally, a troll comes along and ruins it for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Trolls used to be limited to fairy tales, but not anymore. Internet trolls are people who bully others online because they enjoy it. It might be because the troll is a young kid who thinks it\u2019s \u201cfunny\u201d to say mean things to people. It might be because that person is lonely and angry and wants to make others miserable.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, it\u2019s not fun. You might get a private message from someone telling you to \u201cgo kill yourself\u201d or telling you to \u201cget over your problems.\u201d They might even try to post this publicly. Sometimes bullies go far enough to post about you on social media even when they aren\u2019t responding to you, and you find it on your own.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what you can do about this.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Report them<\/strong>. Almost every online site has a way for you to contact moderators or administrators. Take advantage of this. If someone is doing this to you, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re doing this to other people too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t feed the trolls.<\/strong> Don\u2019t respond or engage with somebody who\u2019s doing something like this. They\u2019re trying to get a rise out of you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Block them. <\/strong>Most sites have an ability to prevent a user from sending you a message.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Resist the urge to strike back<\/strong>. It can be fun to briefly entertain thoughts of getting somebody back on social media, especially if you know some embarrassing secret about them\u2026 but you may regret that later.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pity them. <\/strong>Turn it on its head for a moment\u2014think how lonely and sad someone must be to do this kind of thing for fun.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Turn off the computer and walk away. <\/strong>Go do something fun. Don\u2019t let the bully\u2019s thoughts go to your head.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check in with your support network.<\/strong> Even though you know the person sending the messages is a jerk, it\u2019s normal to feel hurt by what they said. If somebody says something mean to or about you, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for support or validation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\n<p>Just remember, if a troll\u2019s bullying has affected the way you feel about yourself, it\u2019s okay to get help. It\u2019s not a sign that your skin isn\u2019t \u201cthick enough,\u201d or that you \u201cneed to get over it on your own.\u201d It\u2019s time to reach out to someone you trust, and recognize that you could be feeling the effects of PTSD or another mental health condition.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Online support communities like MHA\u2019s Inspire can be a safe space for people with mental health conditions to share information and provide comfort to each other.
