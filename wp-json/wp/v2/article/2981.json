If you\u2019ve tried two or more treatments and you still experience symptoms of depression, you might have <strong>treatment-resistant depression (TRD)<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">What is treatment-resistant depression (TRD)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If a doctor diagnoses you with TRD, this usually means that you have not responded to at least two different antidepressants after taking them with proper dose and duration. If <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-depression\/\">symptoms of depression<\/a>, such as sadness, an \u201cempty\u201d mood, hopelessness, decreased energy and concentration, thoughts of or attempts at suicide, etc., continue after you have tried two or more treatments, you may have TRD. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you have TRD, you are not alone: TRD affects about one third of Americans with depression [1]. Being diagnosed does not mean that you have no treatment options\u2014many treatment options have been shown to work for TRD patients. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How is TRD treated?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">There are many ways to treat TRD. In addition to the wide variety of traditional antidepressants available, there are newer medical treatments, such as psychedelic medicine and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Psychedelic medicine<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">\u2014namely <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-ketamine-treat-depression\/\"><strong>ketamine <\/strong><\/a>(FDA-approved as an anesthetic but widely prescribed off-label for mental health conditions) and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-esketamine-treat-depression\/\"><strong>esketamine <\/strong><\/a>(FDA-approved for TRD)\u2014have been shown to work for patients with TRD [2].\u00a0When used correctly, they are very effective as a treatment for depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Both of these treatments have temporary effects. In order to continue their antidepressant effects, they must be given to patients more than once. The long-term effects and safety of repeated ketamine and esketamine treatments are still being determined. However, many clinicians have found it to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with TRD. If you want to learn more about what a treatment session might look like, Osmind has <a href=\"https:\/\/members.osmind.org\/page\/wiki-directory\/3\/\">clinician- and patient-validated guides for both ketamine and esketamine<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> is another FDA-approved treatment that is effective in reducing symptoms of TRD. It\u2019s a non-invasive treatment in which a doctor will apply brief magnetic pulses to your brain for about 40 minutes once a day, five days a week, for six or more weeks. This is typically done in a doctor\u2019s office. There are different types of TMS, so it&#8217;s important to ask your doctor for more details. If this treatment works for you, your symptoms may improve or go away completely. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Antidepressants <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">may still work for people with TRD. It&#8217;s possible that you just haven\u2019t found one that works best for you, so this may still be an option. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-meds-treat-depression\/\">Different antidepressants will work in different ways<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-fast-do-depression-meds-work\/\">medications take from two or more weeks to become fully effective<\/a> [3]. Sometimes you might need a higher dose of a medication that you\u2019re trying for it to be effective. Many people find that combining more than one antidepressant can be helpful. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-the-right-medication-for-my-mental-health\/\">Be sure to talk with your doctor about options if the antidepressant that you\u2019re trying is not working.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">What other options do I have?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Not all treatments for TRD involve medication. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-to-expect\/\">Therapy <\/a>is one of the most effective treatments for depression. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-dont-want-to-go-therapy\/\">Therapy can be a long and sometimes difficult process<\/a>, but stick with it\u2014it can be truly life-changing. If you\u2019ve worked with a therapist already and it hasn\u2019t helped, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-a-therapist\/\">try searching for a different kind of therapist<\/a> who might be a better fit for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-improve-my-mental-health-on-my-own\/\">There are also things you can do on your own<\/a>. Lifestyle changes, like improving your eating, sleeping, and exercise habits, can be helpful for many people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are a few final things to keep in mind as you seek treatment for TRD:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">If you are experiencing any debilitating symptoms (anything that prevents you from functioning at work or school, or if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/im-afraid-im-going-to-kill-myself\/\">thinking seriously about suicide<\/a>), be sure to seek help right away. A doctor or therapist will be able to help ensure that you receive the treatment that you need as soon as possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Keep track of your mood and symptoms while seeking and trying new treatments. You can do this by <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-can-keeping-a-journal-do-for-my-mental-health\/\">writing in a journal<\/a>, on a calendar, or even an app. This can be shared with your doctor to ensure that you are getting the best treatment possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Sharing your own experiences and learning about other options can lead to finding a treatment that works better for you.
