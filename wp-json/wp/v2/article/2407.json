The following information may be of help to you in deciding how you want to begin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Psychotherapy<\/strong>.\u00a0 Although it may seem painful to face the trauma you went through, doing so with the help of a mental health professional can help you get better. There are different types of therapy you can ask about. If one doesn\u2019t work for you, you can try a different one.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy<\/strong> helps you change the thought patterns that keep you from overcoming your anxiety.<\/li>\n<li>During <strong>exposure therapy<\/strong>, you work with a mental health professional to help you confront the memories and situations that cause your distress.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cognitive Processing Therapy<\/strong> helps you process your emotions about the traumatic event and learn how to challenge your thinking patterns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Psychodynamic psychotherapy<\/strong> focuses on identifying current life situations that set off traumatic memories and worsen PTSD symptoms.<\/li>\n<li>During <strong>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)<\/strong>, you think about the trauma while the therapist waves a hand or baton in front of you.\u00a0 You follow the movements with your eyes.\u00a0 You may wonder how something like this could help, but it has been shown to help your brain process your memories and reduce your negative feelings about the memories.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Couples counseling <\/strong>and <strong>family therapy<\/strong> helps couples and family members understand each other.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Medicine<\/strong>, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs, is used to treat the symptoms of PTSD.\u00a0 It lowers anxiety and depression and helps with other symptoms.\u00a0 Sedatives can help with sleep problems.\u00a0 Anti-anxiety medicine may also help.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Support groups<\/strong>. This form of therapy, led by a mental health professional, involves groups of four to 12 people with similar issues to talk about. Talking to other survivors of trauma can be a helpful step in your recovery.\u00a0 You can share your thoughts to help resolve your feelings, gain confidence in coping with your memories and symptoms and find comfort in knowing you\u2019re not alone.
