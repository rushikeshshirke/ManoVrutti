You might feel forced to happily accept negative treatment.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no open space to express your thoughts and feelings freely. You aren\u2019t able to thrive and feel safe within your own family&#8230; And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.<\/p>\n<h2>Signs of a Dysfunctional Family<\/h2>\n<p>No family acts the same\u2014and all families experience some level of dysfunction. But there are some clear signs you can look for to indicate bigger problems:<\/p>\n<h3>Addiction<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-addiction\/\">Addiction<\/a> can lead to so many different <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/is-it-ok-to-drink-with-my-parents-or-family\/\">unhealthy relationships among family members<\/a>. &#8217;12-Step&#8217;\u00a0programs, and even government-funded research studies, now recognize the effects addiction can have on the emotional health of a family \u2013 even\u00a0from generation to generation [2].<\/p>\n<h3>Perfectionism<\/h3>\n<p>Expectations of perfection are wholly unrealistic\u2014they just damage relationships. Families set themselves up for failure and anger by always expecting their kids or relatives to get everything right.<\/p>\n<p>Expecting everything to be perfect puts a lot of pressure on everyone involved. Living with the knowledge you\u2019ll never be good enough for your family\u2019s jacked-up expectations can damage your emotional health in the long term.<\/p>\n<h3>Abuse or neglect<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-abuse\/\">Abuse usually indicates active harm<\/a> like verbal, physical, or violence. <strong>Neglect<\/strong>\u00a0is inactive harm, either physical\u00a0or\u00a0emotional: not feeding your child, or withholding love, interest, or attention.<\/p>\n<p>Both abuse and neglect are extremely problematic. Families can get caught in\u00a0cycles\u00a0that normalize harmful treatment. Those who grow up in these families then go on to exhibit the same behaviors to their kids, causing a\u00a0cycle of neglect or abuse [3].<\/p>\n<h3>Unpredictability and fear<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to establish trusting relationships when you live in constant uncertainty or fear.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re never sure how your parents are going to respond, you\u2019re constantly anticipating conflict and can\u2019t express yourself honestly. Instead, you\u2019re just waiting for their next criticisms.<\/p>\n<p>You might even want to avoid things that should be enjoyable, like\u00a0vacations\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-hate-the-holidays\/\">holidays<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Conditional love<\/h3>\n<p>Dysfunctional family members may be incredibly manipulative with their affection,\u00a0giving love\u00a0only when they want something out of you.<\/p>\n<p>Withholding love makes you want to constantly please them, and doesn\u2019t give you the chance to relax and be yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Lack of boundaries<\/h3>\n<p>Examples of a lack of boundaries within the family include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A\u00a0controlling\u00a0parent, who makes life decisions for you and ignores your opinions<\/li>\n<li>An intimidating parent, who actively discourages you from asserting yourself or even just speaking your mind<\/li>\n<li>An older child taking on the role of a parent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No one has their own space. Nobody respects each other\u2019s autonomy. Living like this can lead to unhealthy, codependent relationships later in your life.<\/p>\n<h3>Lack of intimacy<\/h3>\n<p>Your family doesn\u2019t show many signs of closeness. There is no honest emotional support. Your relations are superficial, rather than\u00a0emotionally available.<\/p>\n<p>Relationships like these make it hard for you to be close with anyone, since you haven\u2019t practiced doing so before.<\/p>\n<h3>Poor communication<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no sense of understanding between you and your family members, so you can\u2019t voice your opinions. There\u2019s always tension, and you don\u2019t feel safe communicating with them.<\/p>\n<p>No one talks about their problems and instead, everyone just sweeps\u00a0issues under the rug [1].<\/p>\n<p>And when it comes to planning, nobody respects each others\u2019 time and preferences. There are no\u00a0open lines of communication.<\/p>\n<h2>Understand how dysfunctional behavior affects you<\/h2>\n<p>If you recognize some of the signs of dysfunctional family behavior listed above, you may already recognize their effects on you. However, it can be a long process for some to see these signs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-hate-myself\/\">Having\u00a0low self-confidence or low self-esteem<\/a>\u00a0are examples of how your family can disrupt your life. Social anxiety and\u00a0unexplained aches and pains\u00a0can even be part of it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s common for these traits to repeat themselves throughout generations. Your parents may have picked up on cues from their parents, which their parents picked up from their family.\u00a0Many of us even grow up thinking that our dysfunctional families\u2019\u00a0behavior is normal.<\/p>\n<p>Do not despair: It is possible to break this cycle. The most powerful tool for breaking dysfunctional patterns is your own awareness and willingness to self-examine.<\/p>\n<h2>Dealing with a dysfunctional family<\/h2>\n<p>There are so many reasons for family members to act problematically\u2014from finances, all the way to their past and how\u00a0their\u00a0family members treated\u00a0them. It\u2019s common for these traits to repeat themselves throughout generations. Your parents may have picked up on cues from their parents, which their parents picked up from their family.\u00a0While none of this is your fault, you might still feel a personal burden.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not your job to change your family. You can only take responsibility for yourself and your own actions.<\/p>\n<p>Dysfunctional families follow certain patterns that suck you in and make it hard to move on. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-set-boundaries-with-my-family\/\">Setting boundaries with your family<\/a> is one of the most important steps you can take to escape the negative effects. It also helps to find support outside your family.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">take a mental health test<\/a> to see if you are experiencing mental health effects that may need to be addressed.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Arora &amp; Prakesh.
