And other asexual people may prefer something else. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4p1ra-6-0\">No matter what you prefer, all ace and ace-spectrum individuals are valid members of the LGBTQ+ community<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4p1ra-7-0\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2kj6f-0-0\">We know that LGBTQ+ individuals are more than twice as likely as their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mhanational.org\/sites\/default\/files\/2019-09\/LGBTQ%2B_Mental_Health.pdf\">a mental health condition<\/a><\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2kj6f-1-0\">. But minimal research has focused on the mental health needs of the asexual community. Ace-spectrum people may face unique challenges.<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4q49-0-0\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 data-offset-key=\"83l20-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"83l20-0-0\">What Are Some Common Mental Health Challenges In The Asexual Community?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"ckf49-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"ckf49-0-0\">Uncertainty And Self-Doubt<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"86fvb-0-0\">The lack of visibility around asexuality can make it hard to realize that you&#8217;re asexual. It&#8217;s common to first know something about you is different from many of your peers. But not realize that it&#8217;s a completely normal and valid identity that others share. This can lead to self-questioning: <\/span><em>If sex is natural, am I broken? Can I really be like this, or is something wrong with me?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"86fvb-2-0\">You&#8217;re not broken and nothing&#8217;s wrong with you. And it can help to hear that from people who have been in your shoes. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"86fvb-3-0\">Do some research and find articles, books, or even social media posts written by asexual people about their journey<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"86fvb-4-0\">. If you don&#8217;t know where to start, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.asexuality.org\/\"><span data-offset-key=\"86fvb-5-0\">www.asexuality.org<\/span><\/a><span data-offset-key=\"86fvb-6-0\">\u00a0has some great resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"7lp1c-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"7lp1c-0-0\">Imposter syndrome<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-0-0\">Many LGBTQ+ folks deal with imposter syndrome. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-1-0\">Or feeling like a fraud about their sexuality, especially soon after coming to terms with a label that feels best<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-2-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-3-0\">If you identify as asexual, going through a more sexual phase or engaging in sex with a certain person may make you question your identity<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-4-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-5-0\">If you&#8217;re asexual and heteroromantic\u2014<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-6-0\">romantically<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-7-0\"> attracted to the <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-8-0\">biologically<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-9-0\"> opposite sex or gender\u2014you might feel like you can&#8217;t take up space in the LGBTQ+ community<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-10-0\">. You can! Labels <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-11-0\">are meant<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ab0n-12-0\"> to serve you. You don&#8217;t have to force a label that doesn&#8217;t feel right.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s okay if what feels right changes over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"3vcj9-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"3vcj9-0-0\">Struggling to fit in<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7c0u1-0-0\">Some ace folks may feel like they&#8217;re unable to connect with peers, particularly during puberty, college, or early adulthood<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7c0u1-1-0\">. At certain life stages, it can feel like sex is the only thing your peers care about. There also can be a lot of pressure to talk about people you find attractive or want to be physical with. Navigating this as someone who is asexual can be confusing and uncomfortable.\u00a0<\/span> <span data-offset-key=\"7c0u1-3-0\">Maybe<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7c0u1-4-0\"> you fake your way through the conversations to fit in but end up feeling disconnected from your true self<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7c0u1-5-0\">. Or <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7c0u1-6-0\">maybe<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7c0u1-7-0\"> you don&#8217;t engage in talk about sex and find yourself left out of social circles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"4s1hh-0-0\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7bv1a-0-0\">Try to connect with other asexual and LGBTQ+ folks. You can do this through community events, dating apps, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/q-chat-space\/\">online groups<\/a> on social media or meetup.com. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7bv1a-1-0\">Over time, <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7bv1a-2-0\">being involved<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7bv1a-3-0\"> in the community will likely introduce you to new people who are also asexual<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7bv1a-4-0\">. This can help reduce feelings of loneliness and help protect your mental health.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"17ml1-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"17ml1-0-0\">Anxiety<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8nhor-0-0\">Acknowledging that your sexuality is different than you thought\u2014and different than the &#8220;norm&#8221;\u2014can be difficult<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8nhor-1-0\">. This is especially so for asexual individuals living in a sex-focused culture. You might wonder about what this means for your dating and social lives. It can be stressful to figure out when to tell people you go on dates with and how they&#8217;ll respond.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8ior0-0-0\">Think about what feels best to you.\u00a0<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ior0-1-0\"> If telling people you&#8217;re asexual before you go on a date helps relieve some anxiety about their reaction, then go for it<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ior0-2-0\">. If it doesn&#8217;t, then there&#8217;s no need to bring it up until the time feels right. Feeling prepared can also help you reduce anxiety. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ior0-3-0\">Consider what you want to say, their possible reactions, and how to handle any negativity or harassment<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8ior0-4-0\">. Remember: Your sexuality and identity are your own, and you get to decide how and when you talk about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"fmlcv-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"fmlcv-0-0\">Lack of c<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"fmlcv-1-0\">ulturally<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"fmlcv-2-0\"> relevant care<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-0-0\">The scientific community now acknowledges\u00a0asexuality as a variation in human sexuality rather than a sexual or mental health disorder<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-1-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-2-0\">But many providers are still ill-informed when it comes to working with the asexual community<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-3-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-4-0\">It&#8217;s not uncommon for health care providers to attribute someone&#8217;s asexuality to an underlying health condition<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-5-0\">. This is invalidating and often <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-6-0\">drives those individuals away from continuing care [1]<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-7-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-8-0\">Seeking out LGBTQ+-competent doctors and\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-lgbtq-friendly-therapy\/\"><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-9-0\">therapists<\/span><\/a><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-10-0\">\u00a0can help ensure that you&#8217;re getting care from providers who understand your needs<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"f2fgv-11-0\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"4v56g-0-0\">While no sexuality or gender identity indicates a mental health condition, the LGBTQ+ community is at great risk for mental health challenges due to societal attitudes<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4v56g-1-0\">.
