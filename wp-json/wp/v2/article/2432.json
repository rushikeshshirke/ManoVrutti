Having a mental health condition can be very overwhelming. It affects each person differently. You might be feeling scared, angry, embarrassed, guilty, or confused. On the other hand, some people feel relief at finally having a name for what they\u2019ve been experiencing. It\u2019s okay to feel any of these things\u2014or all of them, or none of them!<\/p>\n<p>Eventually you\u2019ll want to start working through these feelings. But for now, it\u2019s enough to just do your best to acknowledge them. Working through your feelings about mental illness is an ongoing process. It won\u2019t happen all at once.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this so important? Taking time to acknowledge your feelings can help you attend to them instead of letting them sit in your brain, overwhelming you. Having a mental illness is normal. Don\u2019t let your brain or anyone else tell you otherwise.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt&#8217;s ok to feel this pain\u201d<\/p>\n<footer>Rachel, New Zealand<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Talk to someone<\/h2>\n<p>Mental health conditions can feel lonely. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-common-mental-illness\/\">Know that you\u2019re not alone<\/a>\u2014many people struggle with their mental health. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/who-can-i-talk-to-about-my-mental-health\/\">Finding someone to talk to about it<\/a> can help you feel more supported. Start with someone you trust, like a close friend or family member. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019ve had the same experiences, as long as they are willing to listen.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/support-groups\/\">Online support groups are a great place to find support as well<\/a>. They can be less intimidating than talking to someone in person, because you can usually join them anonymously. Start with something really simple, like searching for hashtags on social media. This can help you see just how many people are going through similar things.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel ready, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-expect\/\">consider talking to a therapist as well<\/a>. Many people recommend this as a first step, but it\u2019s okay to spend some time learning more about mental illness on your own first.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn more<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s lots of information about mental health online, including on this website.
