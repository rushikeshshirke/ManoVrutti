How do you feel? What do you see? What is around you? Light? Wind? What does it smell like? What does it sound like?<\/p>\n<p>Open your eyes. Jot down some notes about what benefits you felt being outdoors. Push aside any thoughts about what you \u201cshould\u201d feel and really think about the positives about spending some of your time outdoors.<\/p>\n<h2>Planning<\/h2>\n<p>What is one thing you can do in the next week or two to spend time outdoors for your mental health? In MHA\u2019s Connection Survey, 68% of people answered \u201ctaking a walk\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s often the first activity that comes to mind, but you have other options too! Anything that gets you outside counts as a starting point.<\/p>\n<p>(Examples: reading in the backyard, exercising in the park, a camping trip, etc.)<\/p>\n<h2>Building motivation<\/h2>\n<p>Motivation is tied to pleasure or the avoidance of pain or fear. We feel motivation from things we say or feel inside our minds or from things we get from others or outside ourselves. What gets you motivated? What helps you feel accomplished, appreciated, or loved?<\/p>\n<p>(Examples: checking off a to-do list, hearing verbal praise, spending time with others, doing things that relate to my values, etc.)<\/p>\n<h2>Planning into action<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve done some reflecting, it\u2019s time to start preparing for action. How can you make your answers to \u201cPlanning\u201d and \u201cBuilding Motivation\u201d work together? Or, when working toward your goal, what can you do to keep your mind on the positive it brings to your life?<\/p>\n<p>(Examples: When I take a walk, I\u2019ll check it off my list; I\u2019ll share goals and wins with friends for praise; etc.)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes it\u2019s hard to do the things we want to do\u2014and it\u2019s especially hard to do the things we don\u2019t want to do but know are good for us.
