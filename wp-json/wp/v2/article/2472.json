You\u2019re getting paid, and you don\u2019t even have to leave the comfort of your living room! In some ways, it can be a real blessing for your mental health. But working remotely also comes with a lot of challenges.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep your work and personal life separate<\/h2>\n<p>Many people are able to stop thinking about work when they leave the office and head home for the day. That\u2019s healthy\u2014you can\u2019t be \u201con\u201d all the time! But what happens when your home <em>is<\/em> your office? Without that dramatic change of setting, it can be hard to shift gears and return to living your day-to-day life.<\/p>\n<p>It helps to establish some part of your home as your \u201coffice.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be a separate room. Maybe there\u2019s a certain corner where you work, or a specific chair that helps you feel more productive. You might be able to block off a certain portion of your room with a curtain. Whatever you do, don\u2019t work in bed! It\u2019ll make it <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-sleep\/\">harder to sleep at night<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone will be able to have an \u201coffice\u201d at home. Maybe you don\u2019t have space, or you just don\u2019t like sitting in one place all day. Instead, try to establish a routine that will get you into \u201cwork mode.\u201d Make coffee at the same time every morning, set up the lighting a certain way, or listen to a specific type of music.<\/p>\n<h2>Set boundaries with your employer<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s also tough to maintain a work-life balance when your employer is suddenly \u201cinvading\u201d your home. Ever since smartphones made emails and workplace chats available 24\/7, this has been a problem for a lot of people\u2014but it\u2019s even worse when you\u2019re working from home.<\/p>\n<p>If you can, avoid answering emails outside of regular work hours. If you must, make sure you\u2019re compensated for the extra time, or adjust your hours later in the week to make up the time.<\/p>\n<p>If you also have small children in the home while you&#8217;re working, that makes things even harder. Sometimes, it might simply not be possible for you to completely separate your work life from your home life. That\u2019s okay\u2014we\u2019re all human, and we can\u2019t all be productive all the time. Do your best, but push back when your employer expects more from you than you\u2019re able to give.<\/p>\n<h2>Get organized<\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for people who work from home is feeling productive. It can be harder to keep track of how much time things take and how much you\u2019ve accomplished. That can make you feel overwhelmed, and less confident and positive about your work. There are a couple things you can do to stay on track.<\/p>\n<p>First, do one thing at a time. Multitasking might make you feel more productive at first, but it\u2019s stressful. When you pile on more stress than you need to, you\u2019ll get tired more quickly and enjoy your work less.<\/p>\n<p>Second, define specific and concrete goals for yourself. For example, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to answer 10 emails and write one report.\u201d At the end of the day, you can look back at that goal and see the progress you\u2019ve made. Start with goals that are small and pretty easy to achieve, and then build on those as you gain confidence.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re technologically savvy, you might try using productivity software to track your progress. There are lots of great tools out there. Trello and Google Keep are good examples, but bullet points in a Word doc might be all you need. Or, go low-tech and use sticky notes and a paper calendar. Don\u2019t spend hours trying to find the perfect tool\u2014pick something and stick with it, and only change if you feel like what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working.<\/p>\n<h2>Stay connected<\/h2>\n<p>Working from home can be very isolating. You may not think of work as a part of your social life\u2026 But even if you aren\u2019t friends with your coworkers, there\u2019s still a sense of companionship there. You\u2019re working together on a common goal.<\/p>\n<p>When you work on-site, you tend to see a lot of the same people day after day. You become familiar with their faces and voices. That lets your brain know you\u2019re part of the \u201ctribe.\u201d That\u2019s something you miss out on while working from home\u2014unless you do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>Make an effort to communicate more with your colleagues. Instead of sending an email, hop on a call. If you already have a call scheduled, make it a video chat. Send a coworker a message asking how they\u2019re doing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/15\/815973389\/virtual-happy-hour-anyone-working-from-home-but-keeping-connected\">Set up a digital happy hour<\/a> to get some quality face time in.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of work hours, make plenty of time for social interaction. If you\u2019re quarantined or socially distancing, follow the same idea\u2014call instead of texting; video chat instead of calling. The closer you can get to in-person interactions, the better!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried about your mental health, take one of our <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">online mental health tests<\/a> to see if you are at risk of a mental health condition.
