Doing so in adulthood brings some unique challenges. Adults who have lived most of their lives seeming to be straight may experience <strong>imposter syndrome<\/strong> when coming out and claiming their LGBTQ+ identity. This means feeling self-doubt, feeling like a fraud, or like they\u2019re undeserving of identifying as part of the LGBTQ+ community.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t always control thoughts of self-doubt. But you can work to respond to them in a way that affirms your LGBTQ+ identity. Regardless of your journey with sexuality and gender: Your identity is valid. Feeling secure and confident in who you are is a big factor in protecting your mental health.<\/p>\n<h2>Fear of taking up space<\/h2>\n<p>When you first come out, it\u2019s common to feel like you can\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) claim space in the LGBTQ+ community. Maybe you know you\u2019re not straight, but aren\u2019t sure what you should, or can, call yourself. Maybe you\u2019re worried about how it will look: What will my LGBTQ+ friends think if I suddenly start identifying as part of the community? If I\u2019m happy with my opposite-gender spouse, can I still be part of the LGBTQ+ community? Will my current partner feel betrayed? Is everyone going to think I\u2019m lying? Maybe you\u2019re secure in your identity, but don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re outwardly \u201cgay enough\u201d to be part of the larger LGBTQ+ community \u2013 especially if you don\u2019t already know other LGBTQ+ folks.<\/p>\n<p>Being part of a community can play a large role in your quality of life. Communities act as support systems and prevent isolation. Holding yourself back from identifying with the LGBTQ+ community can also make you feel disconnected from yourself. One way to get through this fear is to put yourself through a sort of exposure therapy. Face your fear in manageable steps\u2014like only bringing up dating with people who you know affirm you, or finding a buddy to arrive at events with. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but keep putting yourself out there! You are not doing anything wrong by being out with your sexuality or gender identity. Push yourself to keep doing it, even if you don\u2019t quite feel like you \u201cdeserve\u201d it yet.<\/p>\n<h2>Insecurity in labels<\/h2>\n<p>Putting a label on your sexuality or gender identity can be validating, but it can also cause a lot of distress. Sometimes self-doubt in your identity manifests as questioning if you\u2019re \u201cgay enough,\u201d bisexual \u201cenough,\u201d or nonbinary \u201cenough\u201d to call yourself that label. Do I deserve to call myself a lesbian if I spent years married to a man and haven\u2019t ever dated a woman? What do I call myself if all I know is that I\u2019m not cisgender?<\/p>\n<p>Labels are meant to serve you, and you can identify as whatever makes you feel the most yourself. If you\u2019re questioning your gender or sexuality, you don\u2019t have to rush to find a term to describe yourself or force a label that doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s also okay for your identities and labels to change and evolve as you do.<\/p>\n<h2>Dating anxiety<\/h2>\n<p>Dating comes with some uncertainty and anxiety for almost everyone. But dating for the first time as an LGBTQ+ adult can be a uniquely intimidating experience. Maybe you were married for 20 years but feel like a teenager again as you prepare for your first date with another man. Maybe you\u2019re worried about if you should tell your date that you recently came out as asexual and how they\u2019ll react. Maybe you\u2019re in your head with self-doubt, wondering how you can be transgender if you didn\u2019t realize it until your forties.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that everyone starts somewhere. You don\u2019t have to start dating before you\u2019re ready\u2014or ever, if you don\u2019t want to! But it\u2019s normal to feel a bit nervous, hesitant, or like you just don\u2019t know how to break into the LGBTQ+ dating scene. If it feels intimidating but <em>is<\/em> something that you want to do, take some of the pressure off of it being a success. Try to view it as an opportunity to learn about what you like, don\u2019t like, and what it\u2019s like to date in the LGBTQ+ community.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Coming out as LGBTQ+ can bring up a lot of emotions, uncertainty, and change. Don\u2019t rush the process \u2013 it\u2019s okay to feel a bit uneasy as you adjust to this new phase of life. It often takes time to feel comfortable outwardly embracing an identity. But if it all feels too overwhelming or doesn\u2019t get easier with some time, consider <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">taking a mental health test<\/a> to see if you may be dealing with symptoms of a mental health condition.
