They may want to suspend them at the first sign of trouble.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/ocr\/docs\/school-climate-and-safety.pdf\">According to the US Department of Education<\/a> (USDOE), kids with disabilities are twice as likely to be suspended or referred to law enforcement as kids without them. They are 5 times more likely to be put in seclusion. They are 6 times more likely to be put in restraints. Scary, huh?<\/p>\n<p>How do you convince people your child isn\u2019t dangerous?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you do:\u00a0<strong>Speak up.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell people that having a mental illness is not the same as being dangerous. One in five children will have a mental illness, and most will never be violent.<\/li>\n<li>Remind people that the big problem with mental health conditions isn\u2019t that they make people aggressive. It\u2019s that they make people go off by themselves because they feel that they have no friends. The solution isn\u2019t isolating them even more. It\u2019s building \u201ccircles of friends\u201d around them.<\/li>\n<li>Share this fact \u2013 kids with mental health conditions are far more likely to be the <em>victims<\/em> of violence than to be violent themselves. USDOE says that 75 percent of bullies in schools are kids without disabilities. But 51 percent of kids who are bullied are kids with disabilities.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, ask for more help for your child. If \u201cacting up\u201d is related to your child\u2019s disability, it\u2019s your right.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By the time teachers, principals, and others learn that your child has a mental illness, your child has probably already acted out\u2014maybe more than once.
