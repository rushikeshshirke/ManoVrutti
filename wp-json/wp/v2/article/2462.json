With so many of us torn between juggling heavy workloads, managing relationships and family responsibilities, and squeezing in outside interests, it&#8217;s no surprise that more than one in four Americans describe themselves as \u201csuper stressed.\u201d And that\u2019s not balanced\u2014or healthy.<\/p>\n<p>In our rush to \u201cget it all done\u201d at the office and at home, it\u2019s easy to forget that as our stress levels spike, our productivity plummets. Stress can zap our concentration, make us irritable or depressed, and harm our personal and professional relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, stress also weakens our immune systems. It makes us susceptible to a variety of ailments, from colds to backaches to heart disease. The newest research shows that chronic stress can actually double our risk of having a heart attack. That statistic alone is enough to raise your blood pressure!<\/p>\n<p>While we all need a certain amount of stress to spur us on and help us perform at our best, the key to managing stress lies in that one magic word: balance. Not only is achieving a healthy work-life balance an attainable goal, but employees and businesses alike see the rewards. When employees are balanced and happy, they are more productive, take fewer sick days, and are more likely to stay in their jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few practical steps we can all take to loosen the grip that stress has on us and win back the balance in our lives. Read on and reap the benefits.<\/p>\n<h2>At work<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Set manageable goals each day.<\/strong> Being able to meet priorities helps us feel a sense of accomplishment and control. The latest research shows that the more control we have over our work, the less stressed we get. So be realistic about workloads and deadlines. Make a to-do list, take care of important tasks first, and eliminate unnecessary ones. Ask for help when necessary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be efficient with your time at work.<\/strong> When we procrastinate, the task often grows in our minds until it seems insurmountable. When you face a big project at work or home, start by dividing it into smaller tasks. Complete the first one before moving on to the next. Give yourself small rewards upon each completion, whether it\u2019s a five-minute break or a walk to the coffee shop. If you feel overwhelmed by routines that seem unnecessary, tell your boss. The less time you spend doing busy work or procrastinating, the more time you can spend productively\u2014or better yet: with friends or family.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask for flexibility.<\/strong> Flex time and remote work are quickly becoming necessities in today\u2019s business world, and many companies are drafting work-life policies. If you ask, they might allow you to work flexible hours or from home a day a week. Research shows that employees who work flexible schedules are more productive and loyal to their employers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take five.<\/strong> Taking a break at work isn\u2019t only acceptable, it\u2019s often encouraged by many employers. Small breaks at work\u2014or on any project\u2014will help clear your head and improve your ability to deal with stress and make good decisions when you jump back into the grind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tune in.<\/strong> Listen to your favorite music at work to foster concentration, reduce stress and anxiety, and stimulate creativity. Studies dating back more than 30 years show the benefits of music in everyday life, including lowered blood pressure. (Be sure to wear headphones if you share office space with others!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Communicate effectively.<\/strong> Be honest with coworkers or your boss when you feel you\u2019re in a bind. Chances are, you\u2019re not alone. But don\u2019t just complain\u2014suggest practical alternatives. Looking at a situation from someone else\u2019s viewpoint can also reduce your stress. In a tense situation, either rethink your strategy or stand your ground, calmly and rationally. Make allowances for other opinions, and compromise. Retreat before you lose control, and allow time for all involved to cool off. You\u2019ll be better equipped to handle the problem constructively later.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Give yourself a break.<\/strong> No one\u2019s perfect! Allow yourself to be human, and just do the best you can.<\/p>\n<h2>At home<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Unplug.<\/strong> The same technology that makes it so easy for us to do our jobs flexibly can also burn us out if we use them 24\/7. By all means, make yourself available\u2014especially if you\u2019ve earned the right to \u201cflex\u201d your hours\u2014but <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/im-afraid-ask-time-work\/\">recognize the need for personal time, too<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Divide and conquer.<\/strong> Make sure responsibilities at home are evenly distributed and clearly outlined\u2014you\u2019ll avoid confusion and problems later.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t over-commit<\/strong>. Do you feel stressed just looking at your calendar? If you\u2019re overscheduled with activities, learn to say \u201cno.\u201d Shed the urge to be a superhero!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get support.<\/strong> Chatting with friends and family can be important to your success at home\u2014or at work\u2014and can even improve your health. People with stronger support systems have stronger immune responses to illnesses than those who lack such support.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take advantage of your company\u2019s Employee Assistance Program (EAP). <\/strong>Many companies offer resources through an EAP, which can save you precious time by providing guidance on issues like where to find a daycare center and caretaking for an elderly parent, as well as referrals to mental health and other services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay active.<\/strong> Aside from its well-known physical benefits, regular exercise reduces stress, depression and anxiety, and enables people to better cope with adversity, according to researchers. It\u2019ll also boost your immune system and keep you out of the doctor\u2019s office. Make time in your schedule for the gym, or take a walk during lunch. Have some fun!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Treat your body right.<\/strong> Being in good shape physically increases your tolerance to stress. Eat right, get some physical movement in, and get adequate rest. Don\u2019t rely on drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes to cope with stress. They\u2019ll only lead to more problems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get help if you need it.<\/strong> Don\u2019t let stress stand in the way of your health and happiness. If you&#8217;re persistently overwhelmed, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-mental-illness\/\">it may be time to seek help from a mental health professional<\/a>. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness! Taking care of yourself is a sign of strength.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>If you think your work-life balance is affecting your mental health, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">take one of our mental health tests<\/a>\u00a0to check in with yourself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a lot of people, the pursuit of a healthy work-life balance seems like an impossible goal.
