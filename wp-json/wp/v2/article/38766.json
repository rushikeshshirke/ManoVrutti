It was\u00a0approved for use in the United States by the FDA in 2015. It is mainly used to treat <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-psychosis\/\">schizophrenia<\/a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/are-there-types-bipolar\/\">bipolar disorder I<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Its chemical name is <strong>cariprazine<\/strong>. As a newer medication, it is not available in generic form.<\/p>\n<h2>How does Vraylar work?<\/h2>\n<p>Vraylar helps balance the levels of neurotransmitters in your brain. <strong>Neurotransmitters<\/strong> are chemicals that help your brain cells communicate with each other.<\/p>\n<p>The main neurotransmitters affected by Vraylar are dopamine and serotonin. <strong>Dopamine<\/strong> plays a role in causing hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorders. <strong>Serotonin<\/strong> affects mood\u2014low serotonin levels are associated with depression. By balancing the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, Vraylar can help treat both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.<\/p>\n<p>Like most antipsychotic medicines, Vraylar works gradually, so it may take some time to notice improvements in symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>The most common <strong>side effects<\/strong> of taking Vraylar are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>difficulty moving or slow movements<\/li>\n<li>tremors<\/li>\n<li>uncontrolled body movements<\/li>\n<li>restlessness<\/li>\n<li>sleepiness<\/li>\n<li>nausea<\/li>\n<li>vomiting<\/li>\n<li>indigestion<\/li>\n<li>weight gain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In rare cases, antipsychotic medications like Vraylar can cause <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-tardive-dyskinesia\/\">tardive dyskinesia (TD)<\/a>, a movement disorder that can become permanent. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-tardive-dyskinesia\/\">TD is treatable<\/a>, especially if you notice it early.<\/p>\n<h2>Vraylar for bipolar disorder<\/h2>\n<p>In bipolar disorder, antipsychotics like Vraylar act as <strong>mood stabilizers<\/strong>. Most mood stabilizers are effective at treating <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-mania\/\">mania<\/a>, but less effective in treating depression. Because Vraylar has a greater effect on serotonin levels, it is more effective for treating depression than many alternatives. It is also effective at treating <strong>mixed episodes<\/strong>, where a person experiences both mania and depression at the same time. [2]<\/p>\n<h2>Vraylar for negative symptoms of schizophrenia<\/h2>\n<p>Symptoms of schizophrenia are divided into \u201cpositive symptoms\u201d, like hallucinations or delusions, and \u201cnegative symptoms\u201d, which include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>social withdrawal<\/li>\n<li>loss of emotion or pleasure<\/li>\n<li>difficulty speaking<\/li>\n<li>difficulty functioning in daily life<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most antipsychotic medications only help with positive symptoms. While Vraylar has not specifically been approved by the FDA for negative symptoms, it does seem to be much more effective for negative symptoms than other antipsychotic medications.
