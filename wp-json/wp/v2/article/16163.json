Or, you may be working through your feelings about it\u2014feelings like guilt, shame, or confusion. For many of us, the question we\u2019re really asking is something like, &#8220;Why is this happening to <em>me<\/em>?&#8221; or &#8220;Why did God give me psychosis?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These questions are common for people when they first start struggling with a mental illness. You might struggle to accept your experiences, wish they might go away, or wonder why they&#8217;re happening at all. You can think of this as grieving the loss of the &#8220;normal&#8221; life you wish you could have. People are looking for answers to make sense of negative feelings, thoughts, or experiences.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing you&#8217;ve done that made you have psychosis. Having a mental illness is not your fault. There&#8217;s no single explanation\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-causes-mental-illness\/\">multiple factors contribute to developing symptoms<\/a> of psychosis. These factors include our genetics, biology, environment, and lifestyle. There are some things you have no control over at all (your genes), and other things you have more control over (your lifestyle choices).<\/p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-16164 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/risk-factors-mha-mhm-toolkit-2015.png\" alt=\"Risk factors for mental illness include genetics, biology, environment, and lifestyle.\" width=\"260\" height=\"246\" \/><figcaption class=\"aligncenter\"><em>Image source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mhanational.org\/mental-health-month-2015-toolkit-download\">MHA Mental Health Month 2015 Toolkit<\/a><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Learning about mental illness and accepting that this is part of your life is a<em> process<\/em>.
