Now you feel guilty for eating something \u201cbad\u201d\u2014which only stresses you out more!<\/p>\n<p>Stress eating, also called <strong>emotional eating<\/strong>\u2014or just \u201ceating your feelings\u201d\u2014is pretty much what it sounds like: eating because you\u2019re stressed, not because you\u2019re hungry. You probably already know that overeating can be a health risk, and that\u2019s not helping\u2014so what can you do now?<\/p>\n<p>There are two main things to think about here: managing your stress level, and maintaining a good relationship with food.<\/p>\n<h2>Managing your stress level<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re eating because of stress, then managing your stress will naturally help you manage your eating. Techniques you use to manage stress are called <strong>coping skills<\/strong>. Stress eating is one example of a coping skill; we do it because it makes us feel better in the moment.<\/p>\n<p>Coping skills can be healthy or unhealthy. Usually what makes them unhealthy is when we rely on a single coping skill too much. For example, most people can drink a beer now and then to relax, but if that\u2019s your go-to every time you\u2019re stressed, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/if-i-drink-a-lot-does-that-make-me-an-alcoholic\/\" data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"181c96e8-c3e4-4558-a844-d8bfac791e88\">it will likely become a problem for you<\/a>. Stress eating is the same way\u2014it\u2019s probably harmless every now and then, but if you\u2019re doing it every time you\u2019re stressed, it\u2019s going to cause problems for you.<\/p>\n<p>So don\u2019t beat yourself up over eating your feelings this time. But next time, try a deep breathing exercise, write in a journal, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-yoga-help-improve-my-mental-health\/\" data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"cab1cf42-e540-4c8d-bf00-918071b2689e\">do some yoga<\/a> instead. The more coping skills you have in your stress management toolbox, the more balanced you\u2019ll be\u2014and health is all about balance.<\/p>\n<h2>Your relationship with food<\/h2>\n<p>Food is something we need to survive. It provides nutrients that keep us alive and healthy. It reminds us of home and makes us feel safe\u2026 and of course, it tastes good. There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of that; food should be something we enjoy, not something we feel guilty about.<\/p>\n<p>But sometimes our relationship with food becomes unhealthy. We start to see food as a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d that can solve all our problems\u2014or we see it as an enemy that we need to avoid. There are a few things we can do to bring our relationship with food back to a healthy place:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ignore your feelings of guilt and shame.<\/strong> Shame is an emotion that lets us know when we\u2019re doing something <em>socially unacceptable<\/em>. But your eating habits are no one else\u2019s business! If your eating habits aren\u2019t lining up with your <em>own<\/em> goals, you can recognize that and make adjustments without feeling guilty or ashamed about it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pay attention to what your body is telling you. <\/strong>Learn to recognize the difference between feeling hungry vs. wanting to eat to change your emotional state. If you\u2019re having a hard time telling the difference, try eating something filling and then wait a little while. If the drive to eat doesn\u2019t go away, it might be more about emotion than hunger.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Learn to enjoy more nutritious foods.<\/strong> That might sound impossible, but there are lots of tasty foods that are also good for you. And they\u2019re usually more filling than junk food, so you end up eating less and feeling more satisfied\u2014without having to think about the <em>amount<\/em> you\u2019re eating at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your relationship with food gets out of control, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-an-eating-disorder\/\" data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"5df0cee0-b0f6-49dd-9528-9f35554a64b4\">it can lead to an eating disorder<\/a>. Eating disorders are the <a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamapsychiatry\/fullarticle\/1107207\">deadliest type of mental illness<\/a>, and they can be difficult to treat.
