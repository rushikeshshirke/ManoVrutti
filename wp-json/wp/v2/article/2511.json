If you\u2019ve recently noticed a loved one moving strangely, it may or may not be a sign of something serious. Examples might include making strange faces, or not being able to keep their hands still.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-help-a-loved-one-with-a-mental-illness\/\">It\u2019s always good to support your loved ones\u2019 health. <\/a>But loved ones have an especially important role when it comes to involuntary movements. First, friends and family are often the first to notice when someone develops strange movements. Your loved one may be surprised when you mention this to them\u2014which brings us to our second point: involuntary movements can be embarrassing for the person experiencing them. Be sure to be sensitive when bringing it up. Assure them that you don\u2019t look at them differently because of it, and offer your support in finding a solution.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding the cause<\/h2>\n<p>Figuring out exactly what\u2019s going on can be tough. There are lots of different reasons why people develop uncontrollable movements.<\/p>\n<p>It could be a nervous tic you developed, or it could be a sign of a <strong>movement disorder<\/strong> based in the brain. There are many of these, and you\u2019ve probably heard of a few, like Parkinson\u2019s Disease. Others are more obscure. You can try to do some research online, but you may have a very hard time narrowing down exactly what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s best for your loved one to see a health care provider\u2014and the sooner, the better.<\/p>\n<p>If your loved one already sees a doctor regularly, you can start there. Not all doctors have the most advanced knowledge about movement disorders, but they can help you find a specialist. (Some health insurance plans won\u2019t let people see a specialist without a referral from a primary care doctor anyway.) That specialist will most likely be a <strong>neurologist<\/strong>\u2014someone who treats conditions related to the brain.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s another challenge, though: visits to the doctor\u2019s office are usually pretty short\u2014about 15 minutes or so. Many people with movement disorders can hide their symptoms for longer than that. Your loved one might even do this unconsciously. Or, their symptoms might be situational\u2014maybe they only do them in certain places, or when they\u2019re very tired, etc. This can make it hard for the doctor to figure out what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, sometimes people have a hard time getting health care professionals to take their symptoms seriously in a situation like this. If possible, try to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-to-help-someone-make-decisions-about-their-mental-health\/\">accompany your loved one to the doctor\u2019s office<\/a>, so you can help describe their movements. Better yet: try to record their movements on video, so you can show the doctor what the movements look like.<\/p>\n<h2>Uncontrollable movements and mental health<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes uncontrollable movements can be related to mental health disorders:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>People with schizophrenia often move in ways that other people find strange or disturbing\u2014or they don\u2019t move at all for long periods of time.<\/li>\n<li>People who are depressed often move very slowly, almost as if they were walking underwater.<\/li>\n<li>Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to sit still.<\/li>\n<li>People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may repeat certain movements, like squinting hard or twitching.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Movement disorders can also appear as a side effect of mental health medications. A common example is <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-tardive-dyskinesia\/\">tardive dyskinesia (TD)<\/a>, which is a side effect of antipsychotic medications. People with TD experience involuntary, jerky, irregular movements of the tongue, lips, face, trunk, arms, legs, hands, and\/or feet. If your loved one\u2019s symptoms appeared after they started taking a medication, encourage them to talk to the doctor who prescribes that medication about what they should do. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-tardive-dyskinesia\/\">TD is treatable<\/a>, and so are many other movement disorders!<\/p>\n<p>For more information about tardive dyskinesia, its impact, and how to manage it, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tardiveimpact.com\/\">visit tardiveimpact.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ul>\n<li>Lees, A.
