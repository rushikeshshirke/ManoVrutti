Mental health conditions such as <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-depression\/?pathway=3369\">depression<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-anxiety\/?pathway=3364\">anxiety<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/bipolar\/\">bipolar disorder<\/a>, and others can make us feel emotionally exhausted as well. But just because you\u2019re emotionally exhausted now, doesn\u2019t mean that you will feel this way forever.<\/p>\n<h2>Feelings and emotions can be exhausting<\/h2>\n<p>Emotions affect us more than we might think. Have you ever felt butterflies in your stomach, had sweaty hands, or a pounding heart? All of these physiological reactions are a response to emotions like anxiety, excitement, or fear.<\/p>\n<p>The emotions, feelings and thoughts will impact how you feel in your body, because they take up energy\u2014even when we don\u2019t realize it. Heaviness, fatigue, lack of motivation, and moving more slowly than usual are all symptoms of exhaustion\u2014both physical and emotional.<\/p>\n<h2>Engaging with others and life can be exhausting<\/h2>\n<p>When we\u2019re feeling emotionally exhausted, it can feel like a chore to keep up interactions with others. Things like having conversations, socializing, or spending time around coworkers, family, and friends may feel like too much. Sometimes replying to text messages, returning phone calls or emails can even feel overwhelming.\u00a0 But this is instinct\u2014your body is asking you to conserve energy so that it can replenish itself.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s ok to listen to this instinct. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-set-boundaries-my-family\/?layout=light\">set boundaries<\/a> by telling people that you\u2019re feeling drained and can\u2019t talk at the moment. Or if it helps, surround yourself with people who make you feel energized instead of drained. Do whatever it is that your mind and body need to rest.<\/p>\n<h2>Pushing yourself beyond your limit is exhausting<\/h2>\n<p>We often keep working when our bodies tell us to stop. We attend an event when we would rather be at home. We volunteer for additional duties or responsibilities because we believe that we can just keep moving and break through the exhaustion. Sometimes we overextend ourselves because we believe that rest has to be earned. Or we push through because we believe that emotional exhaustion isn\u2019t a good enough reason to take some time for ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s important to continue functioning and taking care of yourself, it\u2019s also ok to give yourself a break. Forcing yourself to keep going as normal when you\u2019re feeling exhausted will only make you feel worse in the long run. You may feel that you can\u2019t take time away from your daily responsibilities, but try to rest when you can.<\/p>\n<h2>Refilling your emotional gas tank<\/h2>\n<p>If we think of our emotional well-being as a car, then we need fuel to run. Often when we are emotionally drained, we\u2019re near empty, on empty\u2014or even running on fumes. To refill our emotional gas tanks, we need to do activities that allow us to rest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take a break.\u00a0 <\/strong>Do activities that allow you to shut off your brain. Some examples include doing something monotonous like other chores, going for a drive, or rewatching a movie or episode of a TV show. These activities may not fill up your emotional gas tank completely, but they allow your brain to rest for a bit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get restful sleep. <\/strong>Good sleep helps us regulate our bodies and our minds. But when we\u2019re emotionally exhausted, it may be difficult to sleep. If you find yourself struggling to fall asleep, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-sleep\/\">try these tips<\/a>. Restful sleep helps refill our emotional gas tanks when we are completely drained.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask for help. <\/strong>If you\u2019ve been letting yourself rest and you\u2019re still feeling exhausted, it may be a good idea to talk to a trusted friend or family member who can offer a new perspective. Or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-find-therapist\/\">reaching out to a licensed therapist or counselor<\/a> may help you find the cause of your emotional exhaustion as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s a process. <\/strong>Getting your emotional gas tank from E to full takes time. It\u2019s a combination of finding restful activities, getting good sleep, setting boundaries, and asking for help if needed. The more we practice refueling our gas tanks, the better we get at not letting life overwhelm us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we feel emotionally exhausted, we feel like we don\u2019t have enough energy to do the things we love\u2014or at times, anything at all.\u00a0 Life\u2014things, feelings, and people\u2014requires emotional labor and that\u2019s exhausting.
