People who are addicted to the Internet also often experience negative emotions or withdrawal symptoms when their Internet access is restricted.<\/p>\n<p>Internet addiction may also be called computer addiction, compulsive Internet use, Problematic Internet Use (PIU), Internet dependence, or pathological Internet use. Researchers estimate that 6 percent of people are addicted to the Internet. Some professionals classify Internet addiction as an obsessive-compulsive disorder, while others liken it to an impulse control disorder.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, there is no one specific treatment for Internet addiction.<\/p>\n<p>Internet addiction is treated in a few ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talk therapy is almost always incorporated into the treatment of Internet addiction. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and group therapy are common.<\/li>\n<li>Medication may be used to help manage symptoms of underlying mental illness and control intrusive thoughts about going online.<\/li>\n<li>Exercise may be incorporated into Internet addiction treatment to ease the effects of reduced dopamine in the brain resulting from restricted Internet use.<\/li>\n<li>Internet addiction treatment aims to create boundaries and balance around Internet use rather than eliminating it entirely. However, if there is a certain app, game, or site that seems to be the focus of the addiction, stopping its use may be part of treatment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mentalhealthamerica.net\/conditions\/risky-business-internet-addiction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn more about Internet addiction here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Internet is a wild and wonderful place which has forever changed the way we live, learn, and work \u2013 but when a person can\u2019t find a balance between their time online and their time offline, it can mean problems for their mental health.
