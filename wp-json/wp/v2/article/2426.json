It&#8217;s possible you have to take a step back to really focus on taking care of your brain and reducing stress in your life. Your mental health problems might also feel like a constant in your life \u2013 but you can learn how to accept it and find ways to control the \u201cepisodes\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>You could also choose to ignore the problem. This option doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it go away. Actually, ignoring mental illnesses often makes them worse.<\/p>\n<p>The worse thing you can do is hurt yourself on top of having mental health problems.&nbsp; This is hard when your mental illness is telling you to hurt yourself.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t hurt yourself. Don&#8217;t do drugs. Don&#8217;t beat yourself up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is it like to work on mental health problems? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We can\u2019t promise you the path to getting better will be pain free \u2013 it\u2019s actually not pain free.

It usually hurts a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Recovery is like physical therapy. You can barely walk at first. It hurts like freaking hell. It takes time. You&#8217;ll definitely fall and not want to get up.
