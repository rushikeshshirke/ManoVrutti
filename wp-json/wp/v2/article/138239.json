You feel naked \u2013 raw.<\/p>\n<footer>Heather, 47<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The path to recovery is a long and winding road. It isn\u2019t always straightforward.\u00a0 You\u2019re relearning how to be yourself again which can bring stress and anxiety. Self-doubt can rear its ugly head, and you may ask the question, <em>\u201cCan I do this? Can I fully recover?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can. One day at a time &#8211; that\u2019s how you should look at your recovery. There isn\u2019t just one way to do it. This will be your very own unique journey.<\/p>\n<h2>How long does recovery take?<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>When I was struggling with addiction, I tried to set limits on my use on my own. I knew it was a problem when I would set a goal like don\u2019t use every day, and I couldn\u2019t do that. When I tried periods of sobriety I would ask how long do I have I have to stay sober? Can I let myself use again? Over time, it was easier to set limits when the intensity of the cravings went down.<\/p>\n<footer>Theresa, California<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>You may have times when you feel well, and other times when your symptoms return.\u00a0 Recovery means different things to people. To some, it may mean you\u2019re no longer having symptoms. To others, it means managing symptoms and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/%20diy\/addictions-answer-share-explore\/\">getting control of your life<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Recovery is going to be different for each person because the experience and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/im-addicted-to-more-than-one-substance-what-do-i-do\/\">drug of choice is different in every case<\/a>.\u00a0 You may want to ask yourself what a good, productive life would look like. Recovery can take a while and is hard work&#8230;if you slip up, just start again. Different treatments combined with individual coping skills take time, but it\u2019s worth it!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Don\u2019t give up, continue to discover what looks right for you. Recovery looks different for everyone.<\/p>\n<footer>Vicente, California<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>At first, it\u2019s hard<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>I felt sluggish, couldn\u2019t think clearly, it took over 30 days to get a clear mind.<\/p>\n<footer>Patricia, Virginia<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The going will be tough. Recovery is a hard process. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-dont-know-how-to-be-around-drinking-people-sober\/\">You might feel all alone and that you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle.<\/a> Your head will be messed up, and you won\u2019t be sure how you\u2019re doing. Withdrawals may happen to you, depending on what you might have been using, with symptoms of shaking, sweating, feeling hopeless, and having troubling thoughts. As hard as that can be, you will learn other ways of living.<\/p>\n<p>Relapse\u2014or recurrence is a definite possibility.\u00a0 It happens when you return to using after you decide to quit. These cravings are out of your control. Your feelings will be all over the place, and you will begin to doubt yourself. It is very hard to start over and can feel like you\u2019ve failed, but you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s part of the journey. Know that it will get easier.<\/p>\n<p>An important step will be to identify and create habits that make you feel good in the very beginning and that help you recover. A great start is <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-keep-mental-health-journal\/\">keeping a mental health journal<\/a>, either paper or digital. Twenty minutes is all you need to process your feelings and work through issues that come up.<\/p>\n<h2>You will find balance<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>Gratitude, breaking out of isolation- the addiction was very isolating, and the recovery is about building connections with myself, others, and the spiritual. Self-care&#8230;that\u2019s what I can do instead of the old behaviors.<\/p>\n<footer>Jim, New York<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The balance and moderation you strive for will happen if you stick with it.\u00a0 The process of changing behaviors and priorities doesn\u2019t happen overnight. You can find balance by using different tools.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using can happen when you find a need to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/worksheet-filling-the-void\/\">fill a void or face a need that\u2019s not being met<\/a>.

Try listening to a guided<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZToicYcHIOU\"> meditation<\/a> or try \u201cboxed breathing\u201d where you breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for\u00a0 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, and hold for 4 seconds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are learning to manage a lifelong mental health condition.\u00a0It is possible to recover and heal when you stick with it.<\/p>\n<h2>You\u2019ll need support<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>NA was helpful for me, knowing it was anonymous\u2026 knowing that no one in my circle was there.<\/p>\n<footer>Theresa, California<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to do this alone! Even if you feel uncomfortable, the solution is asking for help.\u00a0 Isolating yourself might be your first thought, but it\u2019s the wrong choice. You don\u2019t want to be alone with your thoughts. And, you\u2019re not always nice to yourself.\u00a0 Not asking for help with basic, real needs is what usually gets people into trouble with addiction in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Be around others who offer experience, strength and hope.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-does-peer-support-look-like\/\">Peer support <\/a>can be useful in recovery. They have lived with similar experiences and you can identify with them. If you need help immediately, you can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"https:\/\/988lifeline.org\/\">988lifeline.org<\/a>.\u00a0 You can also <a href=\"sms:+1-741-741;?&amp;body=MHA\">text \u201cMHA&#8221; to 741-741<\/a> to reach the Crisis Text Line. Another option is medicated-assisted treatment (MAT), which helps stop the cravings.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s never too late to start your day over and begin fresh. Remember, recovery is not a straight path. You can help yourself to a better life and carve out your own journey.
