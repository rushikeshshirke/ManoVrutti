It\u2019s one of the most common mental health conditions among children. And the number of adults diagnosed with ADHD has doubled within the last decade. [1] Most of the information below is from a 2016 study about the <strong>prevalence<\/strong>\u2014or how common ADHD diagnosis and treatment are in children and adults.<\/p>\n<h2>How common is ADHD in children and teens?<\/h2>\n<p>If you or someone you know lives with ADHD, then you are not alone. About 129 million children worldwide have ADHD. In the United States in 2016: [2]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nearly 1 in 10<\/strong> children in the U.S. or about 6.1 million children ages 2-17 or have ever been diagnosed with ADHD<\/li>\n<li><strong>77% of children<\/strong> with a current ADHD diagnosis were receiving treatment\u2014medication, behavioral treatment, or a combination of both. [3]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2 out of 3<\/strong> children living with ADHD had a co-occurring condition such as <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-anxiety\/\">anxiety<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-depression\/\">depression<\/a>, or other <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-mental-illness\/\">mental health<\/a> or behavioral conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Most children diagnosed with ADHD have mild ADHD<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How common is ADHD in adults?<\/h2>\n<p>If you are diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, then you are in good company. Worldwide it\u2019s estimated that 2.8% of adults live with ADHD. In the U.S., it&#8217;s estimated that 2.5% to 4.4% of adults live with ADHD. [1] But this number is increasing. In the United States alone:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>ADHD diagnoses among adults are rising <strong>4 times faster <\/strong>than ADHD diagnoses among children.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Many adults who have ADHD are underdiagnosed <\/strong>compared to children who have ADHD.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In adults, ADHD often co-occurs with other mental health conditions<\/strong>\u2014such as personality disorders, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-addiction\/\">addiction<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-depression\/\">depression<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-anxiety\/\">anxiety<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-bipolar-disorder\/\">bipolar disorder<\/a>\u2014that can mask symptoms of ADHD.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s estimated that <strong>fewer than 20% of adults living with ADHD<\/strong> are diagnosed or receiving treatment. [1]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>ADHD in children and adults by gender<\/h2>\n<p>People of any gender can be diagnosed with ADHD. According to available research and data, there are trends in the prevalence of ADHD in girls and boys and women and men. In children, research shows that boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than girls. This is partly because girls are more likely to have inattentive-type ADHD, which is less visible and doesn\u2019t match stereotypes of ADHD as much as hyperactive\/impulsive type does. It\u2019s estimated that many girls living with ADHD are undiagnosed due to bias in the process of diagnosing ADHD. [1] In the U.S., the percentages of girls and boys ages 2-17 living with ADHD were: [1]<\/p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gender<\/th>\n<th>Percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Girls<\/td>\n<td>5.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boys<\/td>\n<td>12.9%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gender<\/th>\n<th>Percentage of adults diagnosed with ADHD<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Women<\/td>\n<td>3.2%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Men<\/td>\n<td>5.4%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>ADHD in children and adults by race<\/h2>\n<p>ADHD can impact children of any race\/ ethnic group. But due to bias in ADHD diagnosis, white boys are more likely to be diagnosed and treated for ADHD than girls and children of color\u2014even when they are showing symptoms.[4][5] Black children living with ADHD often face stereotypes that contribute to underdiagnoses and misdiagnoses. Their behavior is often interpreted as laziness or defiance instead of symptoms of ADHD.[4]<\/p>\n<p>The chart below shows the prevalence of ADHD in children by race: [2]<\/p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Race \/ Ethnicity<\/th>\n<th>Percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>White<\/td>\n<td>8.4%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black<\/td>\n<td>10.7%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Latinx\/Hispanic<\/td>\n<td>6.0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other<\/td>\n<td>6.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Non-Latinx\/Hispanic<\/td>\n<td>9.1%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>In adults, the number of people diagnosed with ADHD has increased significantly over time. All ADHD diagnosis rates more than doubled across all race\/ ethnic groups in the United States in a single decade. [1]<\/p>\n<p>The same racial disparities children of color with ADHD face, adults of color often experience. [1][5] This includes implicit bias among mental health professionals and inequities in accessing medical care. The underdiagnoses, misdiagnoses, and inequitable treatment of ADHD in adults of color impact critical areas of their lives such as schoolwork, careers, and relationships.
