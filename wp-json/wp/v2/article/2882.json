(You generally need to be off an MAOI for about 2 weeks before starting another antidepressant.)

Instead of a pill, it comes as a skin patch. There is some evidence that it may be more effective and have fewer side effects than other MAOIs.<\/p>\n<h2>How do MAOIs work?<\/h2>\n<p>Like other mental health medications, MAOIs work by restoring the balance of the chemicals in your brain. These chemicals are called <strong>neurotransmitters<\/strong>. The main neurotransmitters affected by antidepressants are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Serotonin<\/strong>, which affects your mood, energy level, appetite, and sleep.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dopamine<\/strong>, which affects motivation and pleasure. Sometimes called the \u201cfeel good chemical.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Norepinephrine<\/strong>, which affects your energy level, focus, and attention. Related to adrenaline and has similar effects.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most antidepressants mainly boost serotonin levels. MAOIs boost all three. In fact, MAOIs helped scientists discover how these chemicals are involved in depression in the first place.<\/p>\n<h2>Side effects of MAOIs<\/h2>\n<p>Common:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dizziness and fainting<\/li>\n<li>Drowsiness, or trouble sleeping<\/li>\n<li>Nausea<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Less Common:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight gain<\/li>\n<li>Muscle cramps or involuntary muscle jerks<\/li>\n<li>Reduced sexual desire or difficulty reaching orgasm<\/li>\n<li>Increased blood pressure<\/li>\n<li>Prickling or tingling sensation in the skin (paresthesia)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Serotonin syndrome<\/strong>, a rare but serious condition involving twitching, sweating, shivering, diarrhea, or seizures. Talk to your doctor right away if you experience signs of serotonin syndrome.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ul>\n<li>Asnis &amp; Henderson.
