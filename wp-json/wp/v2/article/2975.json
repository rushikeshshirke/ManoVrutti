It\u2019s a possible side effect of antipsychotic medications. [1] Finding out you have a movement disorder like TD can be scary\u2014but as time goes on, treatments for it are becoming more effective and available.<\/p>\n<h2>Recognize the symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>Tardive dyskinesia often begins with slight facial tics, such as smacking your lips or sticking out your tongue. Often, people don\u2019t notice that they are doing this until someone else points it out. Since TD is not a very well-known condition, you may not immediately realize what is happening. You also may not make the connection between your movements and the medication you are taking.<\/p>\n<p>The sooner you recognize the symptoms of TD and speak with your healthcare provider about it, the better your chances for a successful recovery. Read our article \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-tardive-dyskinesia\/\">What is tardive dyskinesia?<\/a>\u201d to learn more about the symptoms and causes.<\/p>\n<h2>Talk to your doctor or psychiatrist<\/h2>\n<p>Speak with the doctor who prescribes your mental health medications. Tell them about any side eff\u00adects you are experiencing that could be signs of Tardive Dyskinesia. They will use a tool called the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) to determine if what you are experiencing is actually TD. [2] (It could also be another movement disorder, with a different treatment.)<\/p>\n<p>Many healthcare providers don\u2019t know much about TD. You may have to be persistent. If your doctor doesn\u2019t seem to be taking it seriously, it may be a good idea to find another provider and get a second opinion. If possible, try to find someone who specializes in movement disorders. (Your doctor may be able to refer you to a specialist.)<\/p>\n<h2>Consider adjusting the medication that is causing TD<\/h2>\n<p>Tardive dyskinesia is a side-effect of <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/antipsychotics\/\">antipsychotic medications<\/a> (and a few other medications). The simplest way of treating it is to adjust the medication that is causing it. This could mean:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stopping the medication altogether<\/li>\n<li>Reducing the dosage<\/li>\n<li>Replacing it with another medication that has a lower risk of TD<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Changing your medications can be a difficult decision. There\u2019s probably a good reason why you were put on this medication in the first place. Maybe you\u2019ve tried several different medications in the past, and this is the one that finally worked. You may be worried that if you adjust your medication, your mental health symptoms will come back. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/who-can-i-talk-to-about-my-mental-illness\/\">This is a common feeling when working with mental health medications<\/a>. It\u2019s frustrating and can be scary, but it\u2019s also very normal.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to work with your doctor to determine the risks and benefits of adjusting your medication. Fortunately, this is not your only treatment option! There are other options if you are unable to adjust your medication\u2014or if your TD symptoms don\u2019t go away after adjusting them.<\/p>\n<h2>Treating the symptoms of TD<\/h2>\n<p>Doctors have prescribed a variety of medications and supplements to manage the symptoms of TD. These include herbal supplements, muscle stimulants, and other mental health medications. [3]<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, there were no medications <em>specifically<\/em> developed to manage the symptoms of TD. In the past few years, two new medications have been developed, which work by adjusting levels of dopamine in your brain: [4]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.austedo.com\/tardive-dyskinesia\">Austedo<\/a> (deutetrabenazine)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ingrezza.com\/about-ingrezza-for-tardive-dyskinesia\">Ingrezza<\/a> (valbenazine)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Newer medications can be expensive. Contact your insurance company to make sure they cover these medications. If they don\u2019t, assistance may be available through the companies that make them. Check the websites for these medications for details.<\/p>\n<h2>Coping with emotions related to TD<\/h2>\n<p>The physical aspects of TD also have an emotional impact. You might feel embarrassed or ashamed of your symptoms. You may be frustrated that you finally found a medication that helps you manage your mental health symptoms, only to experience side-effects. There are lots of ways to cope with difficult emotions. Here are just a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/who-can-i-talk-to-about-my-mental-health\/\">Talking to a trusted loved one<\/a>, such as a friend or family member<\/li>\n<li>Finding a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/support-groups\/\">support group<\/a> for people experiencing similar challenges, in-person or online<\/li>\n<li>Talking to a therapist or other mental health worker<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p>For more information about tardive dyskinesia, its impact, and how to manage it, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tardiveimpact.com\/\">visit tardiveimpact.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>American Psychiatric Association.
