Over time, more and more people are getting diagnosed with ADHD. That\u2019s mostly because more <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/why-do-so-many-people-have-adhd\/\">people are aware of ADHD than they used to be<\/a>. But it does raise the question: What actually <em>causes <\/em>ADHD?<\/p>\n<p>Like other mental health conditions, there\u2019s no single explanation for ADHD. Instead, there are a variety of <strong>risk factors<\/strong>. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop ADHD.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these risk factors include: [1, 2]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brain chemistry and structure:<\/strong> People with ADHD often show differences in parts of the brain that deal with attention, behavior, and impulse control. However, it\u2019s not possible to reliably distinguish an \u201cADHD brain\u201d from an average brain. The brain chemicals most relevant to ADHD are dopamine and norepinephrine. [3] Stimulant medications like Ritalin and Adderall affect these chemicals, which is why they often work so well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sleep deprivation:<\/strong> Not getting enough sleep, or getting low-quality sleep, can cause ADHD or make symptoms worse. People with ADHD often stay up much later than the average person, making it hard to get enough sleep every night. If you have a sleep disorder, like insomnia or sleep apnea, treating it may also help with your ADHD symptoms.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Genetics:<\/strong> ADHD often runs in the family. While there\u2019s no single \u201cADHD gene\u201d,\u00a0 there are several genes that make ADHD more likely.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Childhood trauma:<\/strong> Poverty, abuse, and neglect can all increase the risk of a child developing ADHD.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Environment:<\/strong> Children who are exposed to heavy metals like lead and mercury are more likely to develop ADHD early on. Premature birth and other difficulties during pregnancy can also have an effect.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Other mental health conditions:<\/strong> People with ADHD often also deal with things like depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder. [4] Often, treating one mental health condition can help relieve the symptoms of another. Many people with autism also experience symptoms of ADHD. [5]<\/li>\n<li><strong>Highly stimulating technology:<\/strong> Some people blame things like smartphones and video games for ADHD. The evidence for this is mixed, but people with ADHD do often spend more time with smartphones, video games, and the Internet. [6, 7, 8] And setting limits on screen time is a good idea for everyone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These risk factors don\u2019t just affect who will develop ADHD in the first place. They also affect how severe their symptoms will be. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/are-there-different-types-of-adhd\/\">different types of ADHD<\/a>, and each one may have slightly different risk factors.<\/p>\n<p>Not all these risk factors are something you can control\u2014but some of them are, like sleep habits and screen time. Medications, therapy, and lifestyle changes can help you manage your ADHD and live a full and happy life. At the end of the day, knowing <em>why <\/em>you have ADHD is less important than <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-adhd\/\">figuring out what works for you<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>If you think you may have ADHD, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/adhd\/\">take our free and confidential ADHD Test<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Jaramillo et al.
