Maybe you\u2019re talking to someone, and you suddenly picture yourself punching them in the face. Or you can\u2019t stop picturing random people naked. You don\u2019t want to think about this stuff, so why does it keep happening?<\/p>\n<p>These are called <strong>intrusive thoughts<\/strong>, and just about everyone has them from time to time [1]. Usually, people are able to ignore these thoughts and move on. But sometimes, intrusive thoughts can get out of hand. If your thoughts are causing you a lot of distress or getting in the way of your daily life, it could be a sign of a mental health condition. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-mental-illness\/\">Seeking treatment can help you learn to manage the thoughts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a few different types of intrusive thoughts, and what they might mean.<\/p>\n<h2>Thinking about hurting yourself or someone else<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes intrusive thoughts can be violent. You might think about hurting yourself or someone else. Usually, there\u2019s no intent behind it\u2014you don\u2019t actually <em>want<\/em> to do those things; it\u2019s just a random thought that pops into your head. But you might be afraid that deep down inside, part of you <em>does<\/em> want to act out, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re thinking about it so much.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughts like these may be <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-anxiety\/\">a sign of an anxiety disorder<\/a>, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People experiencing <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-postpartum-depression-ppd\/\">postpartum depression<\/a> may have intrusive thoughts about harming their baby.<\/p>\n<p>If you <em>do<\/em> have any intent to follow through on these thoughts, or if you\u2019re already acting out, that\u2019s beyond intrusive thoughts. If you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-feel-out-of-control\/\">having trouble controlling aggressive behavior<\/a>, you\u2019ll need to learn how to manage your emotions in a more constructive way.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-want-to-die\/\">thinking of committing suicide<\/a>, you can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"http:\/\/988lifeline.org\/\">988lifeline.org<\/a>. You can also <a href=\"sms:+1-741-741;?&amp;body=MHA\">text &#8220;MHA&#8221; to 741-741<\/a> to reach the Crisis Text Line. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/need-talk-someone-warmlines\/\">Warmlines<\/a> are an excellent place for non-crisis support.<\/p>\n<h2>Intrusive sexual thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>Most people\u2014regardless of gender\u2014think about sex quite a bit [2]. It\u2019s completely natural. But if you\u2019re ashamed of these thoughts, or you think having them makes you a bad person, you can get fixated on them [3, 4]. Remember that thoughts are just thoughts\u2014even if the thoughts are shocking or frequent, they don\u2019t define who you are as a person.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also common for people to have intrusive thoughts about their sexual or gender identity. Working out your identity can be a long and difficult process. It can be stressful, and it makes sense that you\u2019d be thinking about it a lot. But it\u2019s also common for people with OCD to obsess over thoughts that don\u2019t seem to line up with their identity [5]. For example, you might identify as lesbian, but have intrusive thoughts about sex with a man.<\/p>\n<h2>Negative self-talk<\/h2>\n<p>Negative thoughts about yourself are <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-depression\/\">a common symptom of depression<\/a>. When you\u2019re feeling down, it\u2019s easy to get stuck on thoughts like \u201cI\u2019m such a loser,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll never amount to anything.\u201d The emotion behind these thoughts can be so strong that they feel like facts, rather than intrusive thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>Negative thoughts often fall into common patterns, called <strong>thinking traps<\/strong>. These are mental shortcuts we take that can lead us to get stuck in our negative thinking. One way to deal with them is to <strong>reframe<\/strong> them\u2014find new, more positive ways of thinking about the same situations. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/thinking-traps-how-can-i-deal-with-negative-thoughts\/\">Click here for a list of common thinking traps and ways to reframe them.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Delusional thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>If your thoughts are bizarre or paranoid, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-psychosis\/\">you might be experiencing signs of psychosis<\/a>. For example, you might feel like the FBI is watching everything you do, or that someone is trying to poison you. You might even <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-see-or-hear-things-arent-there\/\">see or hear things that no one else does<\/a>. Psychosis can be a sign of a mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Sometimes drugs can also cause psychosis.<\/p>\n<h2>Other intrusive thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>These are just a few of the most common types of intrusive thoughts. There are many more. The important thing is to realize that intrusive thoughts are something that <em>happens to you<\/em>, not something that <em>defines<\/em> you. If you think you might be experiencing any of the types of mental illness discussed here, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">take one of our mental health tests<\/a> to find out if you\u2019re at risk.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Radomsky et al.
