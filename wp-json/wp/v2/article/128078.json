Everyone has a different path or way of telling each person in their life about their struggle.<\/p>\n<h2>Think about what you want from the conversation<\/h2>\n<p>What do you really want to get out of the conversation with your parents?\u00a0 You should think about the outcome of the discussion before you go to them.\u00a0 Here are some questions to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What kind of support do you want from your parents?<\/li>\n<li>How do you think they will respond based on their past experiences?<\/li>\n<li>Do you want them to go to therapy with you?<\/li>\n<li>Are there cultural differences you want to consider, such as \u201cwe don\u2019t air our dirty laundry outside the family?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>What if your parents are the reason you\u2019re using \u2013 do you want their help, and in what way?<\/li>\n<li>Are you looking to them for emotional support, or do you want something specific?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s scary to wonder if telling your parents will get you what you want.\u00a0 They may be helpful or not. Arming yourself with the right questions will make you feel better and more prepared.<\/p>\n<h2>Prepare for the conversation<\/h2>\n<p>OK \u2013 now you\u2019re ready to have the tough conversation with your parents.\u00a0You need to plan out what you\u2019re going to say, anticipate their reactions and questions, and how to handle them. Here are some ways that you can prepare for the conversation:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the end in mind and think about what you want from your parents.\u00a0If you want them to just listen or help you, tell them.<\/li>\n<li>Remember to ask for what you need.<\/li>\n<li>Prepare for hard questions in advance.<\/li>\n<li>Practice and prepare using the outline\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/preparing-to-share-talking-about-hard-topics\/\">this worksheet<\/a> can help you with this.<\/li>\n<li>Consider having someone there when you tell your parents for support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Addiction can bring up feelings of blame, anger, and hurt.\u00a0It\u2019s best to know in advance how you\u2019re going to respond so you know what to do in the moment.\u00a0 You can move the conversation to suit your needs.<\/p>\n<h2>What you might expect<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>My nephew lives with me and is struggling. He didn\u2019t tell me directly.\u00a0 I saw things. I asked, and he said no. I had to convey to him that he needed help, and I wanted to help him.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to talk to people and tell them his business.\u00a0 I had to go to different places to find him support\/therapy to help him open up.<\/p>\n<footer>Patricia, 55<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It takes a lot of courage to ask for help. Be prepared for the shock factor.\u00a0 Most parents are going to feel hurt and may cry.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to be ready for that so it doesn\u2019t hurt you.\u00a0 You also have to be prepared for what comes next.\u00a0 Are they going to help you or kick you out?\u00a0 The hope is that they will support you through this, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t go as expected, and you leave feeling defeated.\u00a0 It\u2019s ok to walk away. You have the right to take care of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You can always try again at another time or find another person who will support you.\u00a0 Make sure you have a safe place to go after the conversation or a person you trust.\u00a0 Using coping strategies like taking deep breaths, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/need-talk-someone-warmlines\/\">calling a warmline<\/a> or going somewhere might help you avoid using or drinking.<\/p>\n<h2>What if I can\u2019t tell my parents?<\/h2>\n<p>If you think your parents won\u2019t be supportive, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-tell-someone-i-have-a-problem-with-drugs-or-alcohol\/\">think about others you can talk to<\/a>.\u00a0 If it\u2019s not safe to tell your parents, that\u2019s OK. Parents most likely know something is wrong, and if they don\u2019t know, you have to question your relationship with them.<\/p>\n<p>Find people who you trust that will support you so you have a backup plan.\u00a0 Walk through that conversation so you know what to say.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-does-peer-support-look-like\/\">Peer support<\/a> can help you if you don\u2019t have anyone else and can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/connect\/\">MHA\u2019s Connect Section<\/a>.\u00a0 Someone close in age to you who \u2018gets it\u201d can help you with your recovery.\u00a0 Finding the right support system can be hard, but it\u2019s worth it.\u00a0 Find at <em>least one person in your life<\/em> who can play that role for you.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, you may not have the ideal conversation, but it\u2019s a start.\u00a0 You\u2019ve opened up the discussion, and you\u2019re zeroing in on getting well.\u00a0 It will be difficult at times.\u00a0 But you have started on the road to recovery and begun to let go of your addiction.\u00a0 A healthy you is in sight.\u00a0 You can make it
