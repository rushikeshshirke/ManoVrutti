Imagine what it feels like to accept it.<\/li>\n<li>Imagine how you\u2019d change your behaviors or actions if you accepted this reality. Imagine how the world would feel if you could let go.<\/li>\n<li>Think about this reality. Can you accept it in your body? Where are you carrying the resistance to accept this reality? Do you carry that weight in your shoulders or your back? Is there tension or physical pain? Can you practice feeling your emotions in your body and then<br \/>\npractice releasing them from your body?<\/li>\n<li>Do you feel disappointment, sadness, or grief right now? Sit with that. Acknowledge it. Allow yourself to feel these feelings. Understand that it&#8217;s ok and expected to feel disappointment, sadness, or grief. Write down anything specific about these thoughts and feelings.<\/li>\n<li>Despite the pain of this reality, what makes life worth living? Write those things down to remind yourself.<\/li>\n<li>If you find yourself struggling at this point, write down some pros and cons of accepting or not accepting this reality.
