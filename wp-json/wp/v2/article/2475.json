You want to help, but you\u2019re not really sure how. How can you talk about what they\u2019re going through without making things worse?<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t try to convince them it\u2019s not real<\/h2>\n<p>From the outside, it seems obvious that what the person is seeing, hearing, or thinking isn\u2019t real. You might think that if only you can convince them it\u2019s a delusion, everything will go back to normal.<\/p>\n<p>But when someone is experiencing a psychotic episode, their delusions become <strong>fixed<\/strong>. This means that the person has absolutely no doubt that what they think, feel, see, or hear is real. There\u2019s nothing you can do or say to convince them otherwise\u2026 But you also won\u2019t make the delusions more fixed if you talk about them. Talking about the delusions in the right way can actually be helpful!<\/p>\n<h2>Rolling with the delusions<\/h2>\n<p>If your friend or family member is constantly talking about delusions, it&#8217;s best to \u201croll with it\u201d until you can figure out what will help.<\/p>\n<p>Rolling with delusions means talking to your family or friend about what other changes can help reduce stress. So for example, if they believe someone is watching them, what changes can you make in the house to help them feel safe? A conversation might look like, &#8220;Ok, so you feel like ____, what do you think will make it better?&#8221; Identify behaviors, supports, or environmental changes that will help them to feel calm.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that <strong>your goal is to get through this period with minimal stress<\/strong>, not to convince them that their delusions aren\u2019t real. (If anything, arguing with them about their delusions can stress them out\u2014and stress can make a psychotic episode worse.)<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can work with medical professionals to identify what can be done. Often this will involve medication, and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/do-i-need-go-hospital\/\">possibly hospitalization<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning from psychosis<\/h2>\n<p>Once the person recovers\u2014they become stable and realize that what they experienced wasn\u2019t real\u2014your instinct might be to avoid talking about their delusions. It\u2019s natural to want to just go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d But if you just pretend it didn\u2019t happen, you\u2019re missing out on an opportunity to gain lessons from their psychotic episode.<\/p>\n<p>Understand that <strong>delusions and hallucinations are also reflections of real fears and trauma<\/strong>. There\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re having this particular delusion, and why it\u2019s affecting them this way. Once the psychotic episode is over and the person realizes it wasn\u2019t real, understanding the symbolism behind the delusion can help them recover.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring the delusion, ask them what they think their delusions or hallucinations were about. It\u2019s good to review your crisis plan (or make one if you don\u2019t have one), and talk about their options for medications or support. And talk about your own feelings and experiences. Having open, safe, and constant communication is key to a successful recovery.<\/p>\n<p>In her TED Talk, Eleonor Longden talks about how looking for the symbolism in her hallucinations helped her recover from psychosis:<\/p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 854px;\">\n<div style=\"position: relative; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"TED Talk by Eleanor Longden: The Voices in my Head\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.ted.com\/talks\/eleanor_longden_the_voices_in_my_head\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hearing-voices.org\/\">Hearing Voices Network<\/a> is a great resource to help you understand how to listen to delusions and hallucinations rather than fight them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Watching someone you care about experience delusions is scary.
