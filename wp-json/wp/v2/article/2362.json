It becomes hard to tell what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. The symptoms can be mild or extreme.<\/p>\n<p>Although most people think of psychosis as a mental health condition, people experiencing psychosis often have spiritual or supernatural explanations for what is happening to them.<\/p>\n<p>Psychosis can show up in many different ways:<\/p>\n<h2>Perception<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hearing sounds or voices that others don\u2019t<\/li>\n<li>Seeing ghost-like shadows or wavy lines<\/li>\n<li>Suddenly having a decreased sense of smell<\/li>\n<li>Becoming very sensitive to light, sound, or touch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Behavior<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Withdrawing from family and friends<\/li>\n<li>Anger or fear towards loved ones<\/li>\n<li>Changes in sleep, including reversal: sleeping during the day and staying awake at night<\/li>\n<li>Changes in appetite<\/li>\n<li>Neglecting personal hygiene<\/li>\n<li>Behaviors that are strange or don\u2019t seem like \u201cyou\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Nonsensical or bizarre speech or writing<\/li>\n<li>Suddenly being unable to function at work or school<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Thoughts<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling disconnected or numb about important situations<\/li>\n<li>Feeling like things aren\u2019t real or quite right<\/li>\n<li>Believing that you are constantly being watched, or that other people can read your mind<\/li>\n<li>Extreme fear for no apparent reason<\/li>\n<li>Paranoia or bizarre fears that won\u2019t go away<\/li>\n<li>Trouble focusing and remembering things<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Psychosis is a symptom, not a specific mental health condition. People most commonly think of it as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychiatry.org\/patients-families\/schizophrenia\/what-is-schizophrenia\">symptom of schizophrenia<\/a>, but it can also show up <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-mania\/\">in bipolar disorder during a manic episode<\/a>. There\u2019s even such a thing as <a href=\"https:\/\/webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/psychotic-depression\">psychotic depression<\/a>. Some medications or recreational drugs can also trigger psychosis. So can extreme stress or sleep deprivation.<\/p>\n<p>From the outside, it&#8217;s easy to look at someone experiencing psychosis and say that they&#8217;ve &#8220;lost touch with reality.&#8221; But the things the person is experiencing can feel as real to them as anything else. You can think of it instead as <em>living in a different reality from the one everyone else experiences<\/em>. Feeling isolated from other people is often a major component of psychosis.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There\u2019s different levels of psychosis. You could be hallucinating and know that something\u2019s off, but you could be completely not lucid. I had a period where I didn\u2019t even know I was psychotic, because I didn\u2019t know what reality I was in. It exists on a spectrum.<\/p>\n<footer>Abbey, 23<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Psychosis treatment &amp; recovery<\/h2>\n<p>Psychosis is fairly common: about 3% of people experience it. It tends to get worse over time, so it&#8217;s important to start seeking treatment as early as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Experiencing psychosis can be scary and confusing, and friends and family may not know what to do when they want to help. When you\u2019re trying to help someone with psychosis, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that whatever they\u2019re experiencing is real to them.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that recovery is possible. Whether it is a single experience with psychosis or something that occurs throughout a person\u2019s life, people who experience psychosis can live full, meaningful lives and contribute to their communities. Treatment, services, and supports are available to help people develop a plan based on what they need and want to achieve.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Psychosis impacts my daily life less than it used to. At the beginning, it consumed my life (as well as other symptoms). I started getting a lot better about 3 years ago, and I&#8217;ve improved every year since.<\/p>\n<footer>Autum, 26<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If you or someone you care about is struggling with psychosis, it\u2019s important to reach out for professional help as soon as possible.
