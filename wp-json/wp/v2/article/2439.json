Some illnesses can\u2019t be cured\u2014like diabetes. Once a person gets diabetes, they\u2019ll have it for the rest of their life. But even a lifelong illness like diabetes can be <strong>treated<\/strong>. People who take their medications regularly and make some lifestyle changes can live long and healthy lives. These medications and lifestyle changes are <strong>treatments<\/strong> for diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Mental illness is the same way. There\u2019s no <em>cure<\/em> for mental illness, but there are lots of effective <em>treatments<\/em>. People with mental illnesses can <strong>recover<\/strong> and live long and healthy lives.<\/p>\n<h2>What now?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-mental-illness\/\">Treatments for mental illness<\/a> include lifestyle changes, support groups, medications, and therapy. Everyone is different, so you\u2019ll probably need to find a combination that works best for you. Some of these things, like medications and therapy, require working with a professional. But <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-improve-my-mental-health-on-my-own\/\">there are also lots of things you can do on your own<\/a>.
