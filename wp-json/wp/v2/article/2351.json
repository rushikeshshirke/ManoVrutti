It\u2019s easy to feel hopeless and wonder: \u201cAm I just going to feel this way forever?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>People\u2019s experiences vary. Some struggle for a little while and then never experience symptoms of mental illness again. Others struggle off and on throughout their lives. Some people fight a near constant battle with mental illness. There\u2019s really no way to tell which of these will be you. All you can do is focus on how to address the symptoms you\u2019re experiencing now.<\/p>\n<h2>Treatment and self-help<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/is-mental-illness-curable\/\">there\u2019s no cure for mental illness<\/a>\u2014no way to guarantee that it will never come back.

It\u2019s more likely to only get worse without some kind of intervention.<\/p>\n<h2>Recovery<\/h2>\n<p>Just as mental illness affects everyone in a slightly different way, each person\u2019s recovery is unique. Some people are able to eliminate their symptoms completely. More commonly, people are able to reduce their symptoms to a manageable level. They are able to keep mental illness from controlling their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Many people even get to a point where they feel grateful for what they\u2019ve learned by living with and recovering from a mental illness. It\u2019s okay if you never get to that point\u2014it\u2019s okay to just accept it, and do what you need to do to take care of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Recovery from mental illness can be a long process and it can be hard work\u2026 But it\u2019s worth it!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you\u2019re at your lowest point, it\u2019s hard to imagine ever feeling better.
