Maybe they made you second-guess your memory of something that happened. Or they downplayed your feelings, causing you to question if you overreacted. They turn the story around to make it seem like you are at fault\u2014deflecting attention and blame away from them to make you feel guilty. This type of emotional manipulation is called gaslighting.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehotline.org\/resources\/what-is-gaslighting\/\">Gaslighting<\/a> is a form of emotional abuse where a person makes you doubt yourself or question your account of an incident. <strong>Gaslighting can come from a romantic partner, a boss, a friend, or anyone else.<\/strong> It is done to gain power over you and avoid responsibility for <a href=\"\/content\/what-abuse\/\">the abuse that is being inflicted<\/a>. Gaslighting is incredibly harmful. It makes you question your own sanity, can lead to anxiety or depression, and can even trigger nervous breakdowns. Here are a few signs to help you tell if you or someone you know is experiencing this form of emotional abuse:<\/p>\n<h2>You question if your feelings are justified.<\/h2>\n<p>After an argument, you wonder if you are the one being too sensitive or dramatic. The person dismisses your feelings, making you feel like they aren\u2019t warranted or that you can\u2019t keep your emotions in check. They might tell you that \u201cyou\u2019re just overreacting\u201d or to \u201cstop making everything such a big deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>You second-guess your recollection of past events.<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re told that it never happened or that you are misremembering the details. For some reason, the other person\u2019s interpretation of an event does not match yours\u2014and it\u2019s making you question just how reliable your own memory is, or how justified your reaction is. They might tell you that \u201cYou have a selective memory\u201d or claim that you\u2019re \u201cchanging the story\u201d and \u201cmaking things up\u201d to your own benefit.<\/p>\n<h2>You find yourself apologizing for things you didn\u2019t do.<\/h2>\n<p>You start apologizing unnecessarily, even if you did nothing wrong. After any argument or confrontation, you actually start believing that you might be at fault.<\/p>\n<h2>You make excuses for other people\u2019s bad behavior.<\/h2>\n<p>Your friends and family aren\u2019t the biggest fans of your partner, so you feel the need to defend them. You start keeping certain details about your relationship to yourself and hiding things about the person from the important people in your life. You know your partner\u2019s behavior would be seen as unacceptable, so you\u2019re ashamed to expose the dynamics of your relationship.<\/p>\n<h2>You think there\u2019s something wrong with you.<\/h2>\n<p>You wonder if you\u2019re losing it or going crazy. When arguing with the person, they\u2019ll tell you that \u201cIt\u2019s all in your head.\u201d You don\u2019t feel good enough, or you can\u2019t seem to get things right. You think it\u2019s your fault and that if you tried harder or did better, the state of your relationship would improve.<\/p>\n<h2>You trust the judgment of others over your own.<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve started to doubt what is or isn\u2019t normal in a relationship. They\u2019ll say things like, \u201cIt\u2019s normal to fight like we do\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t know what makes a good relationship.\u201d So, when given a choice, you doubt your own judgment and think that others have better logic than you do. You don\u2019t trust yourself and have trouble making your own decisions.<\/p>\n<h2>You think something might be off.<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re not as happy and confident as you used to be. Your gut is telling you there is something wrong with your relationship, but you might be afraid to admit it or speak up.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing any of these behaviors, don\u2019t hesitate to take action. Gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse and can be very devastating for anyone who experiences this type of manipulation.
