You want the best for them, and you can see how making a change would help them. It can be painful to see a loved one experience negative consequences from their behaviors. And it can be frustrating when they don\u2019t seem to see how important it is for them to take action.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-mental-illness\/\">Recovering from a mental health condition<\/a>\u00a0usually requires some kind of action. Your loved one may need to make some tough lifestyle changes. Or they may need to work up the courage to seek professional help. As much as you might like to grab them by the shoulders and make them understand, that\u2019s not the most effective way to help them find the motivation they need to start the recovery process.<\/p>\n<h2>Think about your role<\/h2>\n<p>You and your loved one will need to work together to figure out <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-help-loved-one-mental-illness\/\">what your role will be in their recovery<\/a>. Are you there just to provide emotional support and encouragement? Or are you there to keep them accountable? Your role depends both on their needs and your abilities.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to be everything to this person. In fact, you really <em>can\u2019t<\/em> be. Maybe they already have someone who keeps them accountable, and they just need you to listen while they talk things out. If there\u2019s something they need that you can\u2019t provide, maybe you can help them find someone else who can step in and help. Sometimes, this might need to be a professional, like a doctor or a therapist.<\/p>\n<p>If the person lives with you and you take care of their physical or financial needs as well, you may need to separate this from your role in their mental health. For example, if they\u2019re able, it might be reasonable to require them to do some chores in exchange for their free rent. When their mental health gets in the way of them doing that, you\u2019ll need to figure out which takes priority.<\/p>\n<h2>Using change talk<\/h2>\n<p>If someone is having trouble feeling motivated, they usually won\u2019t respond well to being yelled at or pressured into doing things. <strong>Change talk<\/strong> is a way of gently guiding a person toward being more motivated. It takes some patience, but this way when they are ready to change, it\u2019s because of motivation that came from within\u2014not because you forced them to act.<\/p>\n<p>The most important part of change talk is active listening. In <strong>active listening<\/strong>, you spend more time listening than talking. You make sure you understand what they\u2019re trying to say before you try to give advice. There are basically three steps to active listening:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ask open-ended questions<\/strong>\u2014instead of \u201caren\u2019t you going to see a therapist?\u201d you could ask, \u201cwhat\u2019s holding you back from seeing a therapist?\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reflect back what you hear<\/strong> in your own words. You can start by saying something like, \u201cWhat I think I hear you saying is\u2026\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask clarifying questions<\/strong>: \u201cAm I understanding you correctly?\u201d \u201cIs there anything else you wanted to say about that?\u201d Give them an opportunity to correct you if they don\u2019t think you\u2019ve understood.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Active listening isn\u2019t just for motivation\u2014it\u2019s useful for all types of communication. Here are some other tips on how to use change talk to help someone get motivated:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask permission<\/strong> before giving feedback, or when bringing up sensitive topics. Sometimes a person isn\u2019t ready to talk about something. They might be more receptive later. Depending on your role, it may be appropriate to be a bit more firm if they continue to avoid the subject. But even then, it\u2019s important to be sensitive to their discomfort.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask about their reasons for not changing.<\/strong> You might think that allowing them to talk about why they don\u2019t want to change would just make things worse. But listening to their doubts will let them know that you care and you\u2019re doing your best to be supportive. Their doubts won\u2019t go away if they don\u2019t talk about them. Doubts can also give you clues on how to find helpful solutions.<\/li>\n<li>Understand that <strong>having mixed feelings is normal.<\/strong> Maybe one day they are excited to make a change, and the next it seems like they\u2019re back where they started. Or part of them wants to change, but part of them is afraid to. Try helping them list the pros and cons of making the change.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give them credit<\/strong> for the positive changes they <em>do<\/em> make. Remind them of their past accomplishments to help them believe in themselves. If they try something and don\u2019t succeed, give them credit for trying. Sometimes little things like getting out of bed or taking a shower can be a big deal for someone dealing with a mental illness.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remember<\/strong> that things that seem small or silly to you might be a big deal for someone else.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Accepting them as they are<\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, they need to make their own decisions. Mental health treatment is usually not something you can force upon someone and expect it to have a positive effect. If someone refuses to make a change, at some point you need to be able to let it go. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-i-know-if-im-enabling-someone\/\">That doesn\u2019t mean you have to enable them<\/a> by supporting them financially or by doing things for them\u2014it just means that you accept that this is their choice, and that you\u2019ve done all you can.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ul>\n<li>Sobell, L.
