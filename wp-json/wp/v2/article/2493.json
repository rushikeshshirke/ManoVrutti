That\u2019s partly because caregiving can be really stressful, and stress can trigger mental health issues.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve written before about <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/taking-care-someone-too-stressful\/\">the stress of caregiving<\/a>. All the same advice applies here\u2014but even more so. If you struggle with your own mental health, it&#8217;s extra important to take care of yourself, manage expectations, ask for help, and set boundaries.<\/p>\n<h2>Stick to your own treatment plan<\/h2>\n<p>If you already know what helps you stay mentally healthy, stick to it. Don\u2019t skip therapy sessions or stop taking your meds. (Of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-think-my-medication-is-making-me-feel-worse\/\">if you\u2019re taking meds that aren\u2019t working<\/a>, that\u2019s a different story.) If you manage your mental health on your own, make sure you have some form of accountability. Have a friend you check in with every week, or just keep a calendar where you keep track of your self-care.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already have a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-mental-illness\/\">treatment plan<\/a>, it\u2019s time to start working on one. It might seem overwhelming\u2014after all, the last thing you need right now is more work to do! But in the long-run, it\u2019s not only important\u2014it might save your life. Plus, you\u2019ll be a much better caregiver if you\u2019re mentally healthy yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You can start small: take some time to do something you enjoy, or call one of your friends you haven\u2019t talked to in a while. Work your way up to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-can-i-find-support-caregiver\/\">finding a support group for caregivers<\/a>, or making an appointment with a therapist. The important thing is that you\u2019re moving in the right direction.<\/p>\n<h2>Boundaries and expectations<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll also want to take your own mental health into account as you define your role as a caregiver. When you\u2019re setting limits on your expectations, don\u2019t just think about what you can and can\u2019t do <em>physically<\/em>\u2014think about what you can and can\u2019t handle <em>emotionally<\/em>, too. Just because other people can\u2019t see your emotional limits doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not important.<\/p>\n<p>Be aware of the ways in which your mental health affects your caregiving. For example, maybe you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-stop-snapping-people\">more likely to snap at people\u00a0when you\u2019re feeling anxious<\/a>. If the person you\u2019re taking care of also lives with a mental illness, you might sometimes bring out the worst in each other. Depending on your relationship with them, it might make sense to talk to them about what you\u2019re going through. That way, you can both understand each other better and be more patient.<\/p>\n<p>And ask for help! Every caregiver needs help sometimes, and it\u2019s even more important when you\u2019re dealing with mental health issues on top of it. Help comes in a lot of forms: someone can help you with your caregiving, or they can provide emotional support. Even small things can make a big difference.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many people who take care of others also struggle with their own mental health.
