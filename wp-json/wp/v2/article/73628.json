It helps you relieve stress, regulate your nervous system, and get those feel-good chemicals pumping. What isn\u2019t always as clear is how you\u2019re supposed to manage an exercise routine when your <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-mental-illness\/\">mental health condition<\/a> makes it hard.<\/p>\n<p>Physical activity isn\u2019t the easiest when <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-get-motivated\/\">mental illness impacts your motivation<\/a>, energy, and mood. But sometimes it\u2019s at those low moments when you could benefit the most from some movement.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not impossible. You\u2019re totally capable of setting and achieving your exercise goals \u2014 you may just need a few adjustments and a little encouragement. Here&#8217;s a comprehensive guide on what to do before, during, and after exercise to make it more manageable.<\/p>\n<h2>Before exercise<\/h2>\n<h3>Be kind to yourself<\/h3>\n<p>Exercise shouldn\u2019t be something you dread or feel guilty about. Instead, think of it as an act of self-care. Focus less on what you can\u2019t do, and emphasize what you <em>can <\/em>do and the benefits of it. Even if it feels forced at first, <a href=\"https:\/\/idontmind.com\/journal\/theres-power-in-positive-thinking-and-science-agrees\">positive self-talk <\/a>will reinforce healthy thoughts, feelings, and actions. Get in the right mindset with some affirmations:<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>\u201cI don\u2019t have to be perfect. I just have to show up. Whatever I achieve today is enough.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cMy body is capable of so much. Every day, I get stronger.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI respect my body and my mind, and I show up for them by exercising.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI deserve to feel healthy and strong. My body deserves to be taken care of.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cMy body needs both movement and rest. I\u2019m proud of myself for giving it what it needs right now.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cWhen I exercise, I feel good. I will have a fulfilling workout today.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Know your limits<\/h3>\n<p>Ignore any fitness advice that glorifies the \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality. Exercise doesn\u2019t have to hurt, and while it\u2019s good to push yourself sometimes, there\u2019s also no shame in knowing your limits. Working out for 15 minutes is better than not doing it at all, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.self.com\/story\/8-low-impact-cardio-workouts\">low-impact exercises<\/a> can still make you break a sweat \u2014 no running or jumping needed. Plan your workouts according to what feels good for you, not what you think \u201ccounts\u201d as exercise.<\/p>\n<h3>Remove the barriers<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s not the exercise itself that\u2019s hard \u2014 it\u2019s all the steps that come before it. Think about the things that usually hold you back, and try to find a way to make it easier on yourself. And remember, the best solution is the one that works for you, even if it might seem unconventional. For example:<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li><strong>If you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-get-out-bed\/\">hard time getting out of bed<\/a>: <\/strong>Take advantage of the moments that force you to get up. You\u2019ll have to use the bathroom or get food at some point in the day, so keep your workout gear in the bathroom or kitchen. Or just pop a few squats right there in front of the sink, or pace around the dining table a couple times after a meal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li><strong>If you get anxious exercising in public: <\/strong>Stay at home! There are plenty of YouTube workouts and online classes out there. And if you don\u2019t want attention from other people in your household either, try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sweat.com\/blogs\/fitness\/quiet-workouts-small-spaces\">a quiet workout for small spaces<\/a> like your bedroom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li><strong>If you struggle to put on exercise clothes: <\/strong>Instead of changing right before your workout, put them on when you get dressed in the morning and wear them all day. Or ditch the workout clothes altogether! As long as you\u2019re not doing anything super intense, it\u2019s totally fine to do your exercises in pajamas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>During exercise<\/h2>\n<h3>Take baby steps<\/h3>\n<p>Start small with your exercise routine, and then increase the length or intensity at your own pace \u2014 walk for 15 minutes today, then try 30 minutes next week, and then add 3 minutes of jogging the next. It\u2019s also okay if your progress isn\u2019t linear and fluctuates based on your motivation or energy.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re having an especially tough day, break it down <em>even smaller<\/em>. Tell yourself that you\u2019ll just lace up your shoes and see how you feel. Then challenge yourself to stay on the treadmill for one minute. If you get that far, make it five more minutes.<\/p>\n<h3>Make it social<\/h3>\n<p>Exercise can be more fun with company and encouragement from other people. You can schedule a casual bike ride with friends, sign up for a yoga class at a studio, or join a social sports league. Even if you don\u2019t actually want to exercise in the same space, you can still make it social. Commit to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.self.com\/package\/challenges\">fitness challenge<\/a> with a couple friends, make a group chat, and send each other updates on your progress. If you can\u2019t get your IRL friends on board, <a href=\"https:\/\/wodtools.com\/fitness-communities\/\">join an online community<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Incorporate it into your day<\/h3>\n<p>So maybe you don\u2019t quite have the time or energy for a formal exercise routine right now. Just try to find ways to add movement to your usual day. Do some lunges while you brush your teeth, stretch while you watch Netflix, and walk around the house while FaceTiming your friend. Think of it like microdosing your physical activity.<\/p>\n<h3>Gamify it<\/h3>\n<p>The best exercise is the kind that you <em>enjoy<\/em>. Bring some more fun to your workout with a game or app. Try a dancing game that gets you on your feet, or an app that gives you zombie survival missions for your run. If you\u2019re doing it right, you\u2019ll be having so much fun that you won\u2019t even mind breaking a sweat. Here are some options to explore:<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pokemongolive.com\/en\/\">Pok\u00e9mon Go<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/justdancenow.com\/\">Just Dance<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/zombiesrungame.com\/\">Zombies, Run!<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/beatsaber.com\/\">Beat Saber<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nex.inc\/products\/active-arcade\">Active Arcade<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ringfitadventure.nintendo.com\/\">Ring Fit Adventure<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>After exercise<\/h2>\n<h3>Reward yourself<\/h3>\n<p>Boost your motivation by planning something nice for yourself post-workout. You can look forward to grabbing a refreshing smoothie on your way home, or using a new body scrub in the shower to soothe your sore muscles. Instead of punishing yourself when you <em>don\u2019t <\/em>exercise, give yourself some positive reinforcement when you do.<\/p>\n<h3>Track it<\/h3>\n<p>Log your exercise with a fitness tracker, your notes app, or a journal. When you track your exercise, it\u2019s easier to measure your progress, celebrate your successes, and stay motivated. Don\u2019t just write down what you did\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 jot down the way you <em>feel <\/em>after doing it. It\u2019ll inspire you to follow through with your next workout to read about how good it makes you feel, in your own words.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>When you\u2019re exercising while managing your mental health condition, it\u2019s important to give yourself some grace. Some days you\u2019ll crush your workout, and some days you\u2019ll just need to rest, and that\u2019s okay. Be proud of yourself for trying to care for your body and mind.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We know that exercise is good for your mental health.
