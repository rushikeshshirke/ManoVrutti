It\u2019s easy to spiral because you\u2019re focused on guilt. You feel guilty for having depression (for burdening others or not being \u201ccomplete\u201d), which makes you feel worse. Then because you feel like more of a burden, you feel guiltier.<\/p>\n<p>It is not your fault that you are having this experience. Most people\u2014and anyone who has experienced depression\u2014will understand that no one would choose this or just decide it\u2019s better to be depressed. It\u2019s understandable, given the way most of us have been taught to think about mental health, that you might have this reaction. But know that you are not at fault, have nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of, and deserve support and recovery.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cPeople have it worse.\u201d \u201cMy family has been through way more, and they\u2019re fine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to be depressed about.\u201d \u201cI should just suck it up.\u201d These are just some of the messages we get and repeat to ourselves about depression.
