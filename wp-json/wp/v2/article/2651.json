It can feel impossible to get everything done, let alone take care of yourself \u2013 especially if you\u2019re already struggling with a mental health concern like depression or anxiety. By creating routines, we organize our days in such a way that taking care of tasks and ourselves becomes a pattern that makes it easier to get things done without having to think hard about them every time.<\/p>\n<p>This worksheet from Mental Health America&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mhanational.org\/mental-health-month-2020-toolkit-download\">2020 Mental Health Month Toolkit<\/a> can help you develop new healthy routines.<\/p>\n<p><em>This worksheet is <a href=\"\/content\/creando-rutinas-saludables\/\">also available in Spanish<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"btn-download\"><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/MHM-2020-Worksheet-Planning-Your-Routine.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download printable version<\/a><\/div>\n<p><object class=\"embedded-pdf\" title=\"Embedded PDF version of the 'Planning Your Routine' worksheet\" data=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/MHM-2020-Worksheet-Planning-Your-Routine.pdf#view=FitH\" type=\"application\/pdf\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\">\u00a0<\/object><\/p>\n<p><em>Here&#8217;s a web-friendly version of the activity from this worksheet:<\/em><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are some things you want to have as a part of your routine?\n<ul>\n<li>Examples: exercise, reading, quality time with my kids<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>What gets in the way of you accomplishing these goals or tasks?\n<ul>\n<li>Examples: working overtime, needing new glasses, too tired<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>What are things you can do to address the barriers you identified?\n<ul>\n<li>Examples: start with a 30-minute walk, go to bed earlier<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Use a calendar to lay out things you can change and incorporate into your schedule.

[<a href=\"#3\">3<\/a>]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Tips For Success<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create the routine that is right for you. <\/strong>We don\u2019t all have the same schedules or responsibilities and some of us struggle with certain parts of daily life more than others. All healthy routines should include eating a nutrition-rich diet, exercising, and getting enough sleep, but no two routines will be exactly the same. In fact, your routine may not even be exactly the same every day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Start small. <\/strong>Changing up your day-to-day routine all at once probably won\u2019t end up with lasting results. Pick one small thing each week to work on. It could be adding something new and positive, or cutting out a bad habit. Small changes add up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add to your existing habits. <\/strong>You probably already have some habits worked into your routine, like drinking a cup of coffee in the morning. Try adding new habits to existing ones. For instance, if you want to read more, you could set aside ten minutes to read while you have your coffee (instead of drinking it on your drive to work).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make swaps. <\/strong>Think about the things you do during the day that aren\u2019t so healthy and swap them with better behaviors. For example, if you feel sluggish in the afternoons and eat sugary snacks for a quick pick-me-up, try taking a brisk walk instead to get your blood pumping and endorphins flowing. Or if you find yourself having a few alcoholic drinks after a long stressful day, try sipping hot tea instead.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plan ahead. <\/strong>When life gets hectic, you may be tempted to skip out on the new parts of your daily routine. By doing things like prepping meals ahead of time, picking out an outfit the night before work, or having an alternate home workout option for the days you can\u2019t make it to the gym, you help set yourself up for success even when you\u2019re hurried.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make time for things you enjoy. <\/strong>Even if it\u2019s just 15 minutes a day, set aside time to do something you find fun or relaxing\u2014it will release chemical messengers in your body that are good for your physical and mental health.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reward yourself for small victories. <\/strong>Set goals and celebrate when you reach them. Have you added exercise to your weekly routine and worked out every day as planned for the last couple weeks? Treat yourself! Watch a movie you\u2019ve been wanting to see or try out that new video game.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you miss a day. <\/strong>Making life changes can be hard and you might forget to do something that is new to your routine every once in a while. You don\u2019t have to be perfect, just try to do better the next day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Haines, J., McDonald, J., O\u2019Brien, A., Sherry, B., Bottino, C., Scmidt, M.E., Taveras, E.M.
