Sometimes it\u2019s scary, and sometimes it can be exciting\u2026 until we wake up the next day and realize what we\u2019ve done.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s normal to feel out of control every once in a while. We all make mistakes and do things we regret. But if you find yourself losing control all the time, there\u2019s probably more going on.<\/p>\n<h2>Understanding why we do the things we do<\/h2>\n<p>We have a lot of different motivations\u2014some logical, some more emotional. Sometimes these motivations contradict each other. Maybe your emotional brain wants to smack someone, but your logical brain doesn\u2019t want to get arrested.<\/p>\n<p>Logical decisions take more brain power than emotional ones. The more distracted, tired, or stressed we are, the harder it is to think logically. Here are just a few things that can make it harder to control your behaviors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intense emotions.<\/strong> Some of the biggest culprits are anger, fear, stress, and grief. Sometimes we\u2019re not even aware of these emotions, but they still affect our behavior. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/should-i-tell-someone-i-have-a-mental-illness\/\">Talking to someone<\/a> about your feelings and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-keep-mental-health-journal\/\">writing in a journal <\/a>are great ways to sort out what you\u2019re feeling and why.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Restlessness.<\/strong> If you\u2019re not satisfied with your life, you might start making rash decisions\u2014just because you feel stuck. It could be as simple as being bored. Or maybe there\u2019s something you want out of your life that you\u2019re just not getting. Instead of randomly acting out, try to identify what\u2019s missing, and think about how you can change that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your energy level.<\/strong> If you\u2019re physically or mentally drained, you\u2019ll have less energy left for making good decisions. Sometimes all it takes is a nap or a snack to get you into a better headspace.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The people around you. <\/strong>Peer pressure might be a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s a real thing. If you\u2019re hanging out with people who drink a lot, it\u2019s going to be harder to resist that extra glass of wine. Try to surround yourself with people you look up to, who act the way you\u2019d like to act.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Practice.<\/strong> It\u2019s hard to break a habit, but it gets easier with practice. Eventually you can replace bad habits with good ones, and better decision-making will start to come naturally.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Drugs or alcohol.<\/strong> Drugs and alcohol lower your inhibitions. They make you less aware of your surroundings and what\u2019s socially appropriate. They also make it harder to remember your long-term goals and keep your behaviors lined up with them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mental health.<\/strong> Certain mental health conditions have an especially strong effect on behavior. If you have <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/adhd\/\">ADHD<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/bipolar\/\">bipolar disorder<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/psychosis\/\">psychosis<\/a>, you might need more specialized treatment to help you get control over your behavior.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you can\u2019t stop snapping at people, can\u2019t stop drinking, or can\u2019t stop your mind from spiraling into dark places, feeling out of control can be frustrating.
