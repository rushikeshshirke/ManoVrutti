Sometimes it can be difficult to know whether you are <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-mania\/\">manic<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-depression\/\">depressed<\/a>\u2014or neither, or both! It\u2019s especially hard when you first get diagnosed. Bipolar disorder makes you question yourself and your reality. But\u00a0a big part of managing your symptoms is self-awareness. This comes from paying close attention to your moods over time.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep a mood journal<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/guided-journal\/\">Keeping a mood journal<\/a> is a great way to track warning signs of a manic or depressive episode. You might not realize you are experiencing mania or depression until it\u2019s over. Journaling makes it\u00a0easier\u00a0to look back and notice trends to help you recognize it earlier the next time. \u00a0You can write down your feelings or symptoms in a notebook, or a note-taking app. (Try setting a daily reminder on your phone.)\u00a0As you keep track of your moods and symptoms, you\u2019ll start to see how bipolar disorder affects you personally.<\/p>\n<h2>Get an outside perspective<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/who-can-i-talk-to-about-my-bipolar\/\">Getting feedback from someone you trust<\/a> can also be helpful. They might notice something you missed. This can be a close friend, a family member, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-to-expect\/\">or a therapist<\/a>. The feedback might make you uncomfortable or even angry sometimes. That\u2019s okay; it\u2019s all part of the learning process.<\/p>\n<p>If you know someone who also has bipolar disorder, ask them about their experiences. <a href=\"\/connect\">There are\u00a0lots of great resources online too<\/a>. Follow blogs or hashtags about mental illness. Join an online forum. It\u2019s one thing to read a list of symptoms; it\u2019s another to understand how they <em>feel<\/em>. Everyone is different, but there are people out there who have had experiences a lot like yours.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"mixed-episodes\">Mixed episodes<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re still wondering whether you\u2019re manic or depressed, it\u2019s possible you\u2019re having a mixed episode\u2014both mania and depression at the same time. Maybe your mind is racing and you can\u2019t sleep (manic), but you\u2019re also feeling very sad and getting down on yourself (depressed). It may sound strange, but it\u2019s pretty common (<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/are-there-types-of-bipolar\/\">especially in bipolar II<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h2>One step at a time<\/h2>\n<p>The longer you work on building self-awareness, the better you will be at managing your symptoms. Think of each episode as a learning experience that is helping you better prepare for the next time. Eventually, you will be able to catch yourself and your triggers before you get to a crisis point.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living with bipolar disorder can be confusing.
