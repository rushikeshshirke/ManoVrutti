But too often, people we should be able to trust take advantage of us.<\/p>\n<h2>What can abuse look like?<\/h2>\n<p>The most obvious way people abuse each other is through physical violence. But more and more people are realizing that \u201cabuse\u201d can be so much more than that. There\u2019s no simple definition of abuse that everyone uses\u2014but there are a few common ideas that come up when people talk about abuse:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exercising unfair power and control over another person. <\/strong>People who are abused feel unsafe about their situation. They may feel fear of being hurt or attacked emotionally or physically. You can feel like you\u2019re walking on eggshells because you don\u2019t know if what you say or do is going to result in backlash.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Treating another person as an object.<\/strong> Abusive people don\u2019t consider how their actions might be harmful to another person\u2014or they simply don\u2019t care. This could look like: treating you as their property, telling you how to feel, repeatedly telling you mean and hurtful words, diminishing your feelings or perspectives, or hitting you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Twisting the relationship into something it shouldn\u2019t be.<\/strong> There are certain things that are appropriate in some types of relationships but not others. For example, it\u2019s appropriate for parents to lay down rules for their children to follow (assuming those rules are reasonable and enforced fairly). But it\u2019s not okay for a boyfriend to do that to his girlfriend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Who can be abusive? And who can be abused?<\/h2>\n<p>That\u2019s simple: Anyone can be abusive. And anyone can be abused. It\u2019s even possible for two people in a relationship to abuse each other at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>That said, <em>abuse is all about power and control<\/em>\u2014so it\u2019s much easier to be abused by someone who has a lot of power and control over you. Because of this, there are certain relationships that are more likely to be abusive than others:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Men are more likely to be abusers. Women and nonbinary folks are more likely to be the victims.<\/strong> In most societies, men make more money than other people and have more privileges. On average, they are also physically stronger. Even when men are victims of abuse, they are more often abused by other men.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Parents and children. <\/strong>Children are dependent on their parents, especially when they are very young. Sadly, many parents ignore their responsibility to nurture their children, and instead abuse the power they have over them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>People who are marginalized in society are more likely to be abused. <\/strong>People of color, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/experiencing-abuse-in-an-lgbtq-relationship\/\">LGBTQ+ folks<\/a>, and people who are homeless or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-addiction\/\">addicted to drugs or alcohol<\/a> are more likely to be abused.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Abusers often try to increase the amount of power they have in relationships. This makes it easier for them to get away with abuse. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theduluthmodel.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/PowerandControl.pdf\">There are many ways they might do this<\/a>, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Isolating you from other friends and family<\/li>\n<li>Encouraging you to quit your job and depend on them financially<\/li>\n<li>Putting you down, making you feel helpless and worthless<\/li>\n<li>Making you doubt yourself<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/my-partner-doesnt-want-me-to-stop-using-drugs-or-get-better\/\">Encouraging you to use drugs and alcohol<\/a>, which impair your judgment and make it harder to live independently<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What does abuse do to people?<\/h2>\n<p>Being abused is a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-trauma\/\">traumatic experience<\/a>. Trauma has long-lasting effects on our mental health. People who feel abused may experience conditions like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/depression\/\">depression<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/anxiety\/\">anxiety<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/ptsd\/\">PTSD<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Communication in an abusive relationship often includes blaming the victim or diminishing the attacks. This can lead us to doubt ourselves or even reality. We may have trouble trusting our own feelings, trusting other people when they point our red flags, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-gaslighting\/\">knowing what&#8217;s real and what isn\u2019t<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many people who have been abused blame themselves, thinking that the abuse wouldn\u2019t have happened if only we hadn\u2019t provoked the person. Or we might feel stupid for getting into an abusive relationship.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been abused, it\u2019s so important to realize that <strong>the abuse isn\u2019t your fault<\/strong>. We all make mistakes and hurt each other, but there\u2019s nothing you could do that would make it okay for another person to abuse you.<\/p>\n<h2>What if it\u2019s someone I really love?<\/h2>\n<p>Actually, <em>most <\/em>abuse is committed by the people we love. They may even genuinely feel love for us. But love is not enough for a healthy relationship! Someone can love you very much and still hurt you deeply.<\/p>\n<p>Abusive relationships are often very intense\u2014and can be difficult to leave. Abusive relationships create dynamics where it is hard for any one person to leave the other. It may be hard to believe, but there is always a better alternative. You can find happiness and love with someone who also treats you with respect. And it\u2019s better to be alone than to be with someone who abuses you.<\/p>\n<h2>What if the person isn\u2019t doing it on purpose?<\/h2>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t really matter whether someone is being abusive on purpose. They may have good intentions, or not realize what they\u2019re doing. But at the end of the day, if what they are doing is causing physical or emotional harm to another person, it\u2019s still abuse.<\/p>\n<p>It can be really uncomfortable to label someone as an \u201cabuser.\u201d You might feel guilty about using that label. Just remember that your physical and emotional safety is more important than protecting their feelings. You don\u2019t have to say it out loud to them! Just saying it to yourself can help you take it more seriously\u2014and be motivated to make changes.<\/p>\n<h2>What should I do if I\u2019m being abused?<\/h2>\n<p>Leaving an abusive situation can be a difficult process. Often, by the time you have made up your mind to leave, you are already in a situation where the person has a lot of power over you. You may not have a safe place to go if you leave. Take a deep breath and take things one step at a time. You don\u2019t have to leave all at once. Keep these things in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remember: your safety comes first.<\/strong> When you are afraid to leave an abusive situation, it\u2019s okay to lie to your abuser. It\u2019s okay to sneak around. If there are children involved, it\u2019s okay to take them with you. Do whatever it takes to keep yourself safe.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach out for help.<\/strong> This could come from a loved one, an anonymous hotline, or a shelter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create a safety plan.<\/strong> Do you have a safe place to go? Do you have cash? Do you have a phone the abuser can\u2019t access? If you don\u2019t have these things, what can you do to get them without tipping off your abuser?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehotline.org\/\">The National Domestic Violence Hotline<\/a> is a great resource for someone who is trying to leave an abusive situation\u2014or anyone who wants help deciding what to do next.
