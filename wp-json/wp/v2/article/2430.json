The changes relate to how your brain produces and absorbs neurotransmitters, how it\u2019s circuits work, inflammation, and even how it\u2019s built (grey matter). These biological changes can start because you have a family history of depression, or it can start after changes and stressors in your life.<\/p>\n<p>Some people feel depressed but don\u2019t understand why. Like there\u2019s nothing to be sad about but I feel so sad and I can\u2019t control these feelings. If you feel this way \u2013 it\u2019s possible you have a genetic predisposition to depression, that depression might run in your family, or that you have what professionals call \u201cclinical depression.\u201d There\u2019s no environmental explanation for it -but your brain is changing in a way that causes depression symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Other people feel depressed or sad after events and changes in their lives. It is totally normal to feel sad after bad things happen. Feeling grief after losing someone important is expected. Feeling sad during a breakup or changing schools is also expected. But if you feel depressed after a long period of time \u2013 even though things have gotten better \u2013 you might have clinical depression. This might have started with an event \u2013 but grew into something more.<\/p>\n<p>Finally \u2013 if life is really hard, trauma and stress can cause depression. You may be bullied all the time, maybe home life is stressful and unhappy, or school sucks and doesn\u2019t get better. Even though it\u2019s expected that you should feel sad, these types of experiences put you at risk of having depression. It\u2019s especially hard if your situation hasn\u2019t changed and you don\u2019t know what life without sadness feels like.<\/p>\n<p>The biological part and the environmental parts all affect one another. It\u2019s a nature and nurture thing.<\/p>\n<p>Even though there are scientific explanations for what depression is. Trust your gut \u2013 if you feel like you\u2019re depressed, you know that you feel sad and the feeling is not what you want to feel. You can do something about that and getting better is totally possible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Depression is a mental health problem that comes from changes in your brain.
