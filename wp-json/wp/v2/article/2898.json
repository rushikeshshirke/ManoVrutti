They are very similar to the <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris\/\">older and more commonly used SSRIs<\/a>. There is some evidence that SNRIs are more effective in treating severe depression [1]. They can also be used to treat chronic pain [2] and ADHD [3].<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to anxiety and less severe depression: SNRIs are more helpful for some people, whereas SSRIs or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-meds-treat-depression\/\">other antidepressants<\/a> are more helpful for other people. Like any type of medication, they can also have side-effects. The only way to know for sure what works best for you is to try them.<\/p>\n<p>Like other antidepressants, SNRIs work by restoring the balance of the chemicals in your brain (called <strong>neurotransmitters<\/strong>). SNRIs work by boosting two neurotransmitters:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Serotonin<\/strong>, which affects your mood, energy level, appetite, and sleep<\/li>\n<li><strong>Norepinephrine<\/strong>, which affects your energy level, focus and attention. Related to adrenaline and has similar effects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The difference between SNRIs and SSRIs is that SSRIs only affect serotonin.<\/p>\n<h2>How do I take an SNRI?<\/h2>\n<p>SNRIs must be taken every day. It usually takes several weeks before you feel the full effect. Taking a single pill won\u2019t stop a panic attack, for example\u2014but taking it daily may decrease your chances of having a panic attack in the future [4].<\/p>\n<p>You might be tempted to stop taking them as soon as you feel better, thinking that you\u2019ve been cured. Unfortunately, antidepressants are not a cure for depression\u2014they are a way of managing it, not a way of making it go away forever. If you stop taking your antidepressant as soon as you feel better, you will likely go back to being depressed.<\/p>\n<p>If you do decide to stop taking an antidepressant, it\u2019s best to talk to your doctor first. Your doctor can help you reduce the dosage gradually, which will reduce <strong>withdrawal<\/strong> symptoms. (You can often do this by cutting your tablets in half for a few weeks, then into fourths for a few more weeks.) They may also help you find an alternative that has fewer side effects or is more effective.<\/p>\n<h2>Examples of SNRIs<\/h2>\n<p>Even though all SNRIs work in similar ways, they each have slightly different effects. So if one doesn\u2019t work for you, another might. If you\u2019ve tried multiple SNRIs and none of them work well\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-deal-with-the-side-effects-of-my-medications\/\">or they all give you side effects<\/a>\u2014it\u2019s a good idea to ask your doctor about taking a different type of antidepressant.<\/p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Generic name<\/th>\n<th>Brand name(s)<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Desvenlafaxine<\/td>\n<td>Pristiq<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duloxetine<\/td>\n<td>Cymbalta<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Levomilnacipran<\/td>\n<td>Fetzima<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Milnacipran<\/td>\n<td>Savella<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Venlafaxine<\/td>\n<td>Effexor<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>Side effects of SNRIs<\/h2>\n<p>Common [5]:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nausea<\/li>\n<li>Dizziness<\/li>\n<li>Headache, dry mouth, or sweating<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Less Common [5][6]:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sleeping more or less than usual<\/li>\n<li>Weight gain<\/li>\n<li>Low sex drive, or trouble achieving an erection or orgasm<\/li>\n<li>Increased blood pressure<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Thase.
