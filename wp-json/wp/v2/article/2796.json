But not every landlord allows pets. You can get around this if a mental health professional certifies that you need an emotional support animal. There are other types of service animals too\u2014it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re trying to get, because the steps are different for each type.<\/p>\n<h2>Emotional support animals (ESAs)<\/h2>\n<p>An <strong>emotional support animal<\/strong> (ESA) is just what it sounds like\u2014a pet that provides emotional support. ESAs don\u2019t need any special training (beyond the normal training a pet needs). Dogs and cats are the most common, but any domesticated animal can be an ESA.<\/p>\n<p>ESAs are covered under the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.humanesociety.org\/resources\/fair-housing-act-and-assistance-animals\">Fair Housing Act<\/a>. This allows people with an ESA to have their pet in their home even if there is a &#8220;no pet&#8221; policy. The law also prevents additional pet fees for ESAs. Small ESAs can also travel with you on a plane free of charge. Unlike service dogs, ESAs aren\u2019t allowed into other public places that don\u2019t normally allow pets.<\/p>\n<p>In order to get the benefits of an ESA, you will need a \u201cprescription\u201d from a mental health professional. This is basically just a signed letter stating that you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-mental-illness\/\">mental health condition<\/a> and that your pet helps you deal with it. Some landlords and airlines will accept a letter from a medical doctor, but often it needs to be a therapist or a psychiatrist.<\/p>\n<h2>Service animals (dogs only)<\/h2>\n<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines <strong>service animals<\/strong> as dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability [2]. This can be a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. <em>Only dogs<\/em> are legally considered service animals. Other domestic animals are covered only as emotional support animals or therapy animals.<\/p>\n<p>Qualifying for a service dog is simple. Actually getting one is a bit harder. To qualify for a service animal, all you need to do is get written documentation from your healthcare provider that you have and are being treated for an emotional or psychiatric disorder or disability and require the assistance of an animal because of it. The work a dog has been trained to do must specifically relate to your condition. Training a service dog yourself can be difficult and can take years. Usually you would get a service dog from someone else who has already trained it.<\/p>\n<h2>Psychiatric service dogs (PSDs)<\/h2>\n<p>A <strong>psychiatric service dog<\/strong> (PSD) is a specific type of service animal trained to assist those with mental illnesses. These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. For example, a dog may assist someone with PTSD in doing room searches or turning on lights. Or it might help someone in a dissociative episode from wandering into danger. Providing companionship, calming anxiety, or providing a sense of safety merely by its presence are not legally considered &#8220;tasks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure whether to get an ESA or a PSD, think about what your specific needs are. Is this animal going to assist you in tasks you wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to do? You\u2019ll probably need a service animal. Are they primarily going to provide companionship, non-judgmental positive regard, and affection? That sounds more like an ESA, which is much easier to get anyway.<\/p>\n<h2>Therapy animals<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Therapy animals<\/strong> are used in therapeutic settings, like hospitals or nursing homes. Some examples might be a cat that lives at a treatment facility, a dog that is taken to visit people in a disaster area, or a horse used in equestrian therapy. Therapy animals provide affection and comfort to people, but they are different than PSDs or ESAs. They are screened for their ability to perform a specific type of therapy, and they are handled by professionals.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Can you take care of an animal?<\/h2>\n<p>Before getting any kind of pet or service animal, it is important to seriously consider the responsibilities that come along with it. Think about whether you can care for it physically, mentally, and financially. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anythingpawsable.com\/before-partnering-with-a-service-dog\/\">Service animals in particular are a big commitment<\/a>. ESAs are a little easier since they don\u2019t need special training, but any pet is still a commitment. If you can\u2019t handle a dog, consider a lower-maintenance pet like a cat or a fish. If even that is too much, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/mental-health\/plants-self-care\">try starting with a plant<\/a> or a stuffed animal, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-mental-illness\/\">another form of treatment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>Mental Health Foundation.
