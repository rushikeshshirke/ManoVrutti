It\u2019s a law that helps protect your job when you need to take time off for your medical needs. You can also use FMLA to take care of a spouse, child, or parent.<\/p>\n<p>The short answer is that yes,<strong> FMLA does apply to mental health<\/strong>\u2014but there are some things you should keep in mind.<\/p>\n<h2>What does FMLA do for me?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>FMLA says you can have up to 12 weeks of <em>unpaid<\/em> leave. Your company also needs to maintain your group health benefits during this time. But whether they pay wages during this time is up to them.<\/li>\n<li>When the 12 weeks are up, the company must put you back in the same job or an equivalent one (similar pay, similar job duties). In other words, they can\u2019t fire you for using your FMLA\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have the exact same job you had before.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What are the limitations of FMLA?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Your employer may ask for documentation of the mental illness. Only a qualified professional (usually a doctor or a therapist) can provide you with the documentation you need. (<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">Our online mental health tests<\/a> are a helpful tool, but they don&#8217;t count as medical documentation.)<\/li>\n<li>You usually can\u2019t use FMLA until you\u2019ve worked for the company for at least 12 months. This time doesn\u2019t need to be consecutive.<\/li>\n<li>You need to give a 30-day advanced notice if possible.<\/li>\n<li>Not every employer has to follow FMLA. FMLA only applies to employers with 50 or more employees. If you work for a small business, they may voluntarily follow FMLA, but they don\u2019t have to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Will my boss discriminate against me for taking FMLA?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/can-i-be-fired-my-mental-illness\">Employers aren\u2019t legally allowed to discriminate against you because of your health status<\/a>, and many won\u2019t\u2026 but some do. It\u2019s even possible that telling your boss about your mental illness causes them to discriminate against you subconsciously. You should absolutely feel entitled to take leave, but you may need to be prepared to defend yourself or take legal action. Document everything you can to protect yourself in case something happens. Keep track of how much time you are taking off and why\u2014if you need to, you can match this up with the medical records from your health care providers.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. Department of Labor.
