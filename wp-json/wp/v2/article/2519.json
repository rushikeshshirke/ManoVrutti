It shows employees that the work they do is valued and appreciated. It can also increase confidence and motivation to strive for great results.<\/p>\n<h2>But what if you aren\u2019t feeling recognized?<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, feeling under-recognized in the workplace is quite common. As a peer counselor, I\u2019ve seen this lack of recognition stem from a strained relationship with a supervisor, a negative work environment, a general misalignment in values, and so much more. The net result is that the employee feels unheard and undervalued.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling this way at work, it can help to take a step back and evaluate what you need to feel valued. While we can\u2019t always change other people\u2019s behavior, we can reflect on what we need to thrive and move toward this goal with more clarity.<\/p>\n<h3>The five recognition languages<\/h3>\n<p>Recently, I was inspired by a presentation that Katie Dill, the VP of Design at Lyft, gave at the Leadership in Design event. She says there are five different types, or languages, of recognition. Each person has a primary and a secondary language. Although we accept recognition in all five languages, our primary language connects to us on a deeper level, and making feel truly valued and heard.<\/p>\n<p>Recognizing what language you and your team members speak can help enhance communication and promote clarity and alignment.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encouraging Words<\/strong> is the support and reassurance given verbally or in writing. People with this primary language appreciate a personal \u201cthank you\u201d email after completion of a project, or cheering words before a big presentation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tangible Rewards<\/strong> include both monetary compensation, such as a salary increase or bonus, as well as other tangible manifestations of appreciation, such as extra vacation days or a team lunch out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Focused Time <\/strong>involves getting personal and uninterrupted time with the manager, be it a scheduled 1:1 meeting, informal check-in, or dedicated time during a team meeting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Further Autonomy<\/strong> can showcase in being entrusted with a big task without any supervision, or being given freedom to decide what project to take on next. Notice that extra words of encouragement can be perceived as annoying rather than rewarding by someone with this primary language.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Visible Impact <\/strong>manifests in an opportunity to see the effect of a person\u2019s work on their audience, such as hearing the words of appreciation from the customers directly, or discussing their personal contribution to the company.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To read more from Katie about the five recognition languages from a manager\u2019s perspective, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@katiemdill\/to-show-recognition-try-speaking-a-different-language-2f5b0682820c\">check out this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>What can you do if you\u2019ve experienced a lack of recognition at work?<\/h2>\n<p>This can feel really tough, but know you\u2019re not alone. The tips below can help you reflect on why you might be feeling this way, and help you identify gaps that may need to be filled.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reflect on your \u201cRecognition Language.\u201d <\/strong>What language, or languages, resonates with you? This can help you better understand what you need to feel valued.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Notice the moments when you feel you don\u2019t get the appreciation you expect. <\/strong>What need is not being met? Is there no recognition, or is it just given to you in a different language than you were envisioning?<em>\u00a0<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Articulate the type of recognition you need. <\/strong>Remember a time when you felt truly recognized for your work.
