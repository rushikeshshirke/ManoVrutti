If you&#8217;re already feeling depressed or anxious, it&#8217;s even harder! You might have a hard time noticing anything good\u00a0about the situation, or about your life.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that puts you on track for a downward spiral. Thinking positively not only feels better than thinking negatively, but it also helps you find ways to improve your situation! Of course, it&#8217;s easier said than done.<\/p>\n<p>This worksheet from Mental Health America&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/mhanational.org\/mental-health-month-2020-toolkit-download\">2020 Mental Health Month Toolkit<\/a> walks you through four steps you can take to start looking for the good things.<\/p>\n<p><em>This worksheet is <a href=\"\/content\/buscando-lo-bueno\/\">also available in Spanish<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"btn-download\"><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/MHM-2020-Worksheet-Looking-for-Good.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download printable version<\/a><\/div>\n<p><object class=\"embedded-pdf\" title=\"Embedded PDF version of the 'Looking for Good' worksheet\" data=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/MHM-2020-Worksheet-Looking-for-Good.pdf#view=FitH\" type=\"application\/pdf\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\">\u00a0<\/object><\/p>\n<p><em>Here&#8217;s a web-friendly version of the activity from the worksheet:<\/em><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Identify what&#8217;s going on.\u00a0<\/strong>What&#8217;s making you feel bad right now? Maybe it&#8217;s a situation, or a negative thought you keep struggling with.<\/li>\n<li><b>Reframe.\u00a0<\/b>Even though the situation is hard, is there something you have learned from it or some other silver lining? If you could go back and change the original thought, what&#8217;s a healthier thing you can say to yourself? For instance, if you\u2019ve just lost a loved one after they have been extremely sick, does it feel healthier to think about their death as an end to their pain?<\/li>\n<li><b>Practice gratitude.\u00a0<\/b>Are there other things going on in your life that you are thankful for? This doesn\u2019t have to be related to the situation you&#8217;re focusing on. For instance, you can be thankful for your good health, having a stable home to live in, or a recent promotion at work.<\/li>\n<li><b>Once you&#8217;ve found some positives, remind yourself! <\/b>How can you\u00a0reinforce your reframed thoughts and remind yourself of what you are thankful for? Make a list of ways. For example, put them onto post-it notes and stick them in places around your house as visual reminders.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"How To Stay
