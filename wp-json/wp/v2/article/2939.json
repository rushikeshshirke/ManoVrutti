There are lots of reasons why, but let\u2019s take a look at some common ones:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You had a bad experience last time.<\/strong> Not every hospital is the same. As unfair as it is, it\u2019s possible that the hospital you went to last time just wasn\u2019t the best. If you think you might need to go to the hospital again at some point, it might be worth doing some research on a better place to go. Consider writing out a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-a-psychiatric-advance-directive-pad\/\">Psychiatric Advance Directive<\/a>\u00a0specifying where you want to go, and what kinds of treatment you do or don\u2019t want to receive.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s expensive.<\/strong> In the United States, going to the hospital can be expensive. Your insurance may have high copays, or you may not have health insurance at all. Fortunately, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/managing-high-medical-bills-32221-2.html\">there are ways to get financial assistance<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re scared of hitting another low point.<\/strong> When people go to the hospital, it\u2019s usually because they feel like they\u2019re at the end of their rope. Maybe what you&#8217;re really afraid of is that low point\u2014not the hospital itself. In that case, you can try to intervene early by taking a look at your self-care, your participation in therapy, and your use of medications.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re experiencing intrusive thoughts.<\/strong> Some people have persistent, unwanted thoughts about bad things happening to them\u2014like going to the hospital. This can happen even if you\u2019re nowhere close to a point where you actually need to be hospitalized. If this sounds like you, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/types-of-intrusive-thoughts\/\">read more about intrusive thoughts<\/a>. Consider <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-therapy-work-what-to-expect\/\">taking our anxiety test<\/a> as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What other options do I have?<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you decide to go to the hospital again or not, it\u2019s important to remember that you have lots of options.
