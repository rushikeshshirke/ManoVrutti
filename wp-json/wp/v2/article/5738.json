We send flowers to sick family members and write thank you notes to those who do good in our lives. But as simple as it can seem to be gracious and compassionate towards others, we sometimes fall short when the receiver is our own selves.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at six things we can do to cultivate self-love and bring it into our everyday lives.<\/p>\n<h2>1.\u00a0Celebrate your victories.<\/h2>\n<p>Just like you might congratulate a coworker for doing a really great presentation or cheer on your kid in their school play, you should be celebrating your own victories! Whether you perform an eight-hour open-heart surgery or simply get out of bed in the morning, no victory is too small to celebrate.<\/p>\n<p>Be gentle with yourself. Be proud that you are doing your best. If your best is going to work and just making it to the end of the day, then that\u2019s fantastic. Give yourself a long hot shower, or read the next chapter of your favorite book. Celebrate!<\/p>\n<h2>2. Don\u2019t say \u201cmaybe\u201d when you want to say \u201cno.\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>Every time you compromise your own happiness and mental health for the sake of someone else, you are telling yourself that you value others\u2019 well-being above your own. Don\u2019t do it!<\/p>\n<p>For example, if someone at work asks you to cover for them and you are already having a really stressful and tiring day\u2014don\u2019t say maybe, say no. You won\u2019t be able to help others if you don\u2019t help yourself first!<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>3. Don\u2019t apologize for your feelings.<\/h2>\n<p>Your feelings are yours, and they are valid. No one has the right to tell you what you should or should not be feeling (not even yourself). In mindfulness practice, one of the first lessons learned is the art of acknowledging and noticing your feelings without judgment.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, instead of getting upset with yourself because you feel you\u2019re overreacting to an insensitive joke, tell yourself: \u201cI acknowledge that I feel angry,\u201d or, \u201cI notice that I\u2019m feeling upset.\u201d Acknowledging your feelings not only validates them but limits the negative self-talk you might be having about what you\u2019re feeling. And if someone else tries to tell you your feelings are \u201cwrong\u201d? Well, that says more about them than it says about you.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Imagine how clear your path would be if you let go of the opinions of others.<\/h2>\n<p>Others\u2019 opinions should not concern you. Live your life to the happiest, fullest, and best of your ability\u2014whatever that means to you. If that means spending 20 fewer minutes on work in the morning and going for a walk with your dog, then that\u2019s the perfect and absolutely correct thing for you to do! Everyone\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d is different.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>5. Start each day by finding something positive about yourself.<\/h2>\n<p>Maybe you are having a really good hair day. Or maybe you got a great night\u2019s sleep, and you are feeling a bit sharper than usual. Even if it seems really difficult, try your hardest to find one thing you can be happy about with yourself every morning. Maybe it\u2019s even something from the past, a moment you chose compassion when you could have chosen anger. Or a moment when you were truly present with yourself. Then, go into your day feeling guided by that self-love and positivity.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Don\u2019t believe everything in your head.<\/h2>\n<p>We can become so self-critical that it can be difficult to quiet the judgmental voices in our head. It\u2019s important to remember, however, that the inner critic is just trying to keep us small and safe\u2014not happy. We don\u2019t have to listen to it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If a close friend or sibling has a bad day, we are all quick to send them a mood-boosting text or run out and grab dinner with them.
