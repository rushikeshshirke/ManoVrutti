We try to get things right, but they\u2019re still wrong. We try to \u201cbehave,\u201d but we still get in trouble.\u00a0 It can start to feel like there&#8217;s something wrong with us. Mental health conditions like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-anxiety\/\">anxiety<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-depression\/\">depression<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-adhd\/\">ADHD<\/a>, and others can make this feeling worse. Acknowledging this feeling, understanding your thoughts, and changing them can help you figure out what&#8217;s wrong so you can feel better.<\/p>\n<h2>Where does this belief come from?<\/h2>\n<p>Believing that we can\u2019t do anything right may feel like a fact\u2014but it\u2019s not. Though this belief came from somewhere. Our experiences, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-trauma\/\">trauma<\/a>, other people, and even our own mind can affect how we feel about ourselves.<\/p>\n<h3>Other people<\/h3>\n<p>A relative, a friend, a teacher, or someone else may have told you that you can\u2019t do anything right! It\u2019s a hurtful thing to say and the more times you hear it, the more you\u2019re likely to believe it\u2019s true. Statements like this start to change the way that we think about ourselves. But remember just because someone says it, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s true. Your worth is not defined by what others say. It can only be defined by you.<\/p>\n<h3>Our past experiences and trauma<\/h3>\n<p>Our past experiences and trauma can affect how we feel about ourselves. Experiencing difficult situations like bullying, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-abuse\/\">abuse<\/a>, or neglect may <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/am-i-broken\/\">make us believe that we&#8217;re broken<\/a>. But there&#8217;s nothing wrong with us. You are more than your experiences. While our past experiences can shape us, they do not make us who we are.<\/p>\n<h3>Our unmet expectations<\/h3>\n<p>Setting high expectations for ourselves isn\u2019t a bad thing. But it can become a bad thing if we feel like failures for <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-cant-deal-pressure-and-expectations\/\">not meeting those expectations<\/a>. Some examples of setting expectations that ultimately make us feel bad are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Giving ourselves tight deadlines<\/li>\n<li>Setting unrealistic goals<\/li>\n<li>Expecting things from ourselves that we wouldn&#8217;t ask of others<\/li>\n<li>Pushing ourselves beyond our limits<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not meeting the expectations above doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t capable. But it does mean that <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/6-ways-to-practice-self-compassion\/\">you may be too hard on yourself<\/a>. Take time to reflect on all the things in your life that show what you are capable of accomplishing.<\/p>\n<h3>Living with a mental health condition<\/h3>\n<p>Mental health conditions such as <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-anxiety\/\">anxiety<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-depression\/\">depression<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-adhd\/\">ADHD<\/a>, or others may add to this belief. You may find it hard to focus, think clearly, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-feel-out-control\/\">control your emotions<\/a>. You may wonder, &#8220;why can&#8217;t I just be normal?&#8221; or &#8220;why can\u2019t I be like everybody else?&#8221; Living with a mental health condition is difficult. But this doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t do anything right. It takes time to understand your experiences and what can help you feel better.<\/p>\n<h2>Acknowledge your feelings<\/h2>\n<p>The only way to start changing unwanted negative thoughts is to catch yourself falling into the trap of beating yourself up.\u00a0 And working on thinking of kinder and more true thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt\/\">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT<\/a>) this is called \u201creframing.\u201d When the thought, \u201cI can&#8217;t do anything right!&#8221; comes up in your mind, tell yourself to stop. Ask where this thought and feeling comes from. Then take a breath and work on finding a better thought. A better thought is more compassionate and not rooted in past hurt. The thought might sound something like, <em>\u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can\u201d or \u201cI do a lot of things right, I just need more time on this.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Because we believe in our thoughts so strongly, they may feel hard to reframe. It\u2019s OK. Thinking negatively is a habit. But we have the power to change it. Take a pause and try to step away from the situation if you can and come back later. Or ask someone you trust for advice to help you gain a different perspective on what\u2019s making you feel this way. Do your best to not compare yourself to others.\u00a0 And consider all the things you\u2019ve done that make you proud.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Life can be frustrating.
