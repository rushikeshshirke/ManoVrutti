There are also three types of ADHD: predominantly inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive\/impulsive type, and combined type\u2013 experiencing aspects of both inattention and hyperactive-impulsive types.\u00a0 People living with ADHD may experience symptoms in one or a combination of both types. And their ADHD symptoms can change over time.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the common symptoms of ADHD are [1] [2]:<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0Inattention<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Often fails to give close attention or makes careless mistakes<\/li>\n<li>Often has trouble holding attention on tasks and\/or activities<\/li>\n<li>Avoid or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental effort<\/li>\n<li>Is often easily distracted<\/li>\n<li>Often losing things needed for tasks like school papers, keys, wallet, phone, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Often forgets daily tasks such as chores or errands<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Hyperactivity<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talking<\/li>\n<li>Extreme restlessness or difficulty sitting still<\/li>\n<li>Interrupting others or finding it hard to wait your turn<\/li>\n<li>Always \u201con the go\u201d as if driven by a motor<\/li>\n<li>Moves around constantly even in situations where it\u2019s not appropriate<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Impulsivity<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty with self-control<\/li>\n<li>Often acting without thinking<\/li>\n<li>Making decisions before considering long-term consequences<\/li>\n<li>Needing immediate rewards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Symptoms of ADHD can often be confused for or appear alongside other mental health conditions such as <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-anxiety\/?pathway=3364\">anxiety<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-depression\/?pathway=3369\">depression<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-bipolar-disorder\/?pathway=3060\">bipolar disorder<\/a>.\u00a0 In children, ADHD symptoms can be confused with emotional or disciplinary problems or learning disabilities in school.

ADHD may interfere with the ability to function at school, at work, and in relationships.
