Both involve feeling more exited and energetic than usual for a long period of time\u2014at least two weeks at a time. Hypomania looks different for everyone, but it generally includes some of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>having lots of energy<\/li>\n<li>feeling \u201ceuphoric\u201d (excited and happy, or even a little bit \u201chigh\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>feeling extra confident and creative<\/li>\n<li>thinking and speaking more quickly than usual<\/li>\n<li>being easily distracted or annoyed<\/li>\n<li>not sleeping as much as usual<\/li>\n<li>impulsive behavior<\/li>\n<li>mild or moderate anxiety<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you compare this to the list of symptoms of mania, you\u2019ll notice that they\u2019re pretty similar. The main difference is that while mania often gets out of hand and causes lots of problems for people, hypomania is more manageable. Mania can sometimes lead to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-psychosis\/\">psychosis (losing touch with reality)<\/a>, but hypomania never does. That\u2019s good news for people experiencing hypomania\u2026 but because it is less disruptive, it often goes unnoticed or unreported.<\/p>\n<p>People with <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/are-there-types-of-bipolar\/\">bipolar I<\/a> can experience both mania and hypomania.
