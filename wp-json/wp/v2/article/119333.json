It is a difficult experience that can make someone feel shame, guilt, disappointment or feel like they\u2019ve lost progress in their recovery.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s only a moment in time and does not define who you are or determine the rest of your life. Try to be patient with and forgive yourself for what happened.<\/p>\n<p>Like learning any new process, it takes time to get better. When someone learns how to ride a bike, they lose balance and fall many times before they get it right. And each time they fall, they get back on the bike. Recovering from <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/addiction\/\">addiction<\/a> is like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-recovery-like\/\">learning how to live again<\/a>\u2014there may be recurrences, but you can get back up and keep going.<\/p>\n<h2>Recurrence is a part of recovery<\/h2>\n<h3>A compulsion, not a choice<\/h3>\n<p>While using or drinking may have started as a choice, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-addiction\/\">addiction<\/a> is not one. Between 40-60% of people in recovery experience a relapse. [1] When your brain and body have been dependent on a substance for so long, it can feel almost as essential as breathing.<\/p>\n<p>These cravings are compulsions, not choices\u2014they are out of your control. And having a moment of recurrence doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not trying hard enough. It means that the <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/why-cant-i-stop-using-drugs-or-alcohol\/\">recovery process is hard<\/a>. But it is possible.<\/p>\n<p>If you experience a craving or go through withdrawals, it may be difficult to stay strong, but you can do it. Try focusing on what coping strategies are working and what has worked for you in the past to resist using your drug of choice or drinking.<\/p>\n<h3>Accepting recurrence and moving forward<\/h3>\n<p>The truth is that relapse can be very serious. Sometimes it could just be one drink or lead to an overdose. Accepting the recurrence and understanding that you can\u2019t change what happened is the only way to move forward.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to practice <strong>radical acceptance. <\/strong>This means accepting reality without fear or judgment\u2014not being angry with the universe because of the way things are. Radical acceptance is about being honest about what you can and can\u2019t control. For example, you can&#8217;t control the past (you already relapsed), and you can&#8217;t predict the future (you could relapse again), but you can control which coping skills you are using, and you can be honest about whether or not they&#8217;re working.<\/p>\n<p>We have to accept things for the way that they are, and not what we wish them to be. We all wish it were easier to quit using drugs or alcohol, but it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s hard to confront yourself, but it\u2019s necessary for healing. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/practicing-radical-acceptance\/\">This worksheet<\/a> can help you start practicing radical acceptance.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning your triggers<\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>I usually ask someone: \u201cDo you feel that there&#8217;s something that we missed or skipped over, something that&#8217;s coming up for you now that we haven&#8217;t worked on?&#8221;<\/p>\n<footer>Crystal, New York<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>After a recurrence, take time to reflect on what triggered you to want to use or drink. Sometimes triggers can happen faster than we realize\u2014overwhelming us before we can figure out what\u2019s going on. Trying to slow down and identify the feelings and situations that led you to this point can help you learn your triggers. Think about how you felt in the situation:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Were you in a stressful situation?<\/li>\n<li>Were you around certain people?<\/li>\n<li>What were your surroundings like?<\/li>\n<li>Did you want to escape?<\/li>\n<li>Did you want to feel less anxious?<\/li>\n<li>What did you want to feel in that moment?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Self-reflection can help you manage your triggers in the future. You can do this by starting a <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-keep-mental-health-journal\/\">mental health journal<\/a>, using <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/diy\/addictions-answer-share-explore\/\">this tool to reflect on your addiction<\/a>, or talking with someone you trust\u2014a friend, a peer recovery specialist, etc. You can also make a plan that includes using coping skills, setting limits and boundaries, and removing yourself from stressful environments.<\/p>\n<h2>Using your recovery capital<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Recovery capital<\/strong> is anything that you&#8217;re doing to work on your recovery. It\u2019s anything you can gain within your recovery that supports you. You can think of it as time and energy you&#8217;re putting in a bank. Or you can think of it as a toolbox and consider what tools you have to help you in your healing.\u00a0 It can be spiritual or tangible. For example, your recovery capital can be coins, quotes, bracelets\u2014anything that keeps you motivated in your recovery.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what your recovery capital is, it should hold value to you. And be what you can lean on when you feel like you\u2019re unmotivated or straying.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding support<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>I needed to chase my recovery like I chased my addiction<\/p>\n<footer>Crystal, New York<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There are many ways that you can find support following a recurrence. Here are several that you might want to try:<\/p>\n<h3>Talking to someone<\/h3>\n<p>Call or text someone before you use next time. You may want to call someone you trust, a sponsor, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/about-peer-supporters\/\">a peer support specialist<\/a>, etc. Finding someone to talk to at that time\u2014especially someone who has gone through this has the best outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>If you need immediate help, you can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">calling or texting 988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"http:\/\/988lifeline.org\/\">988lifeline.org<\/a>. You can also <a href=\"sms:+1-741-741;?&amp;body=MHA\">text \u201cMHA\u201d to 741-741<\/a> to reach the Crisis Text Line. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/need-talk-someone-warmlines\/\">Warmlines<\/a> are an excellent place for non-crisis support.<\/p>\n<h3>Self-care<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/6-ways-to-practice-self-compassion\/\">Give yourself some self-compassion<\/a>. Use self-care tools like affirmations or quotes to empower yourself. This may be a good time to lean on your recovery capital. Reframing your thoughts to change your self-talk is one way of caring for yourself and <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/changing-thoughts-with-an-ai-assistant\/\">this tool<\/a> can help with that.<\/p>\n<h3>Try something different<\/h3>\n<p>If what you are currently doing isn\u2019t working, then try something new. For example if you&#8217;re going to\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/alcoholics-anonymous\/\">Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/narcotics-anonymous\/\">Narcotics Anonymous (NA)<\/a>, you can change the number of meetings that you\u2019re going to. Trying <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/find-low-cost-or-no-cost-treatment\/\">a different pathway to healing<\/a> such as learning a new coping strategy, medication assisted treatment (MAT), or doing something you haven\u2019t done before, may be the change you need.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue round caret collapsed\" href=\"#references\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"references\" data-toggle-text=\"Hide References\">Show References<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"references\" class=\"references collapse\">\n<ol>\n<li>National Institute of Drug Abuse.( 2022, March 22.) <em>Treatment and Recovery.<\/em> Retrieved from <a href=\"https:\/\/nida.nih.gov\/publications\/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction\/treatment-recovery\">https:\/\/nida.nih.gov\/publications\/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction\/treatment-recovery\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Relapse\u2014or recurrence\u2014happens when someone returns to using a substance or drinking after they\u2019ve decided to quit.
