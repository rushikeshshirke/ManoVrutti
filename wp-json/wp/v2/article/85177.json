From sadness to anger, denial to hopelessness, grief is a complex experience. It can come as a surprise later down the road that our grief is still there. Sometimes memories can bring a flood of emotion back. And you may feel like your grief has lasted longer than it should. Or you\u2019re experiencing grief that you thought was in the past. This is normal. Grief may never go away\u2014 it just changes. It might be helpful to understand why you may still be grieving and what you can do to process your grief.<\/p>\n<h2>Burying the Grief<\/h2>\n<p>While grief can be all-encompassing, people still have lives and responsibilities to attend to. This is one of the reasons we might bury our grief: it just feels like too much to deal with on top of everything else we\u2019ve got going on.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason you might bury your grief is simply because it hurts too much. This is totally understandable\u2014but is likely to result in those painful feelings surfacing again later. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/practicing-radical-acceptance\/\">Dealing with your grief<\/a> head on is painful, and sometimes scary. But it\u2019s ok to feel your feelings. In fact, it\u2019s the most direct path to healing.<\/p>\n<h2>Allowing<\/h2>\n<p>The opposite of burying emotions like sadness, anger, and other emotions, is <strong>allowing<\/strong>. Many of us have been taught not to express our feelings for most of our lives. So this may feel strange at first. But ultimately, allowing the feelings to be what they are is key to processing them in the healthiest way possible.<\/p>\n<p>Prolonged grief can lead to mental health conditions like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-depression\/\">depression<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-anxiety\/\">anxiety<\/a>, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd\/\">PTSD<\/a> in some cases. This isn\u2019t wrong or bad. Allowing ourselves to truly feel and process our grief can help us improve our mental health. There are different resources and coping strategies\u2014like <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-keep-mental-health-journal\/\">journaling to express your feelings<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/helpful-vs-harmful-ways-manage-emotions\/\">being mindful of our emotions<\/a>\u2014that can help you allow yourself to feel and process your grief.<\/p>\n<h2>Loss of Control<\/h2>\n<p>One scary part about losing someone you love is realizing that you have less control than you thought.\u00a0 Your natural reaction may be to become more controlling in other aspects of your life. But this can create more anxiety and may contribute to a prolonged period of grief.<\/p>\n<p>While it might not be easy at first, accepting that <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/i-feel-out-control\/\">you don\u2019t have control of everything<\/a> will ultimately help you with your grief. And it may allow you to approach everyday situations from a calmer place\u2014which is ultimately good for your mental health.<\/p>\n<h2>When Grief Becomes a Bigger Issue<\/h2>\n<p>Unprocessed grief can take over our ability to function. If we don\u2019t give ourselves time and space to process our grief, then it can lead to mental health conditions like depression or anxiety. For example, we may find ourselves not wanting to leave the house.\u00a0 Or we may not want to connect with others or do things that we used to.<\/p>\n<p>If your grief is affecting your daily life or your ability to take care of yourself, then it\u2019s time to reach out for support. Consider talking to a friend or loved one or joining a support group so you don\u2019t have to carry your grief alone. You may also want to reach out to a mental health professional. There are ways to process your grief that allow you to continue living a healthy life.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s natural to miss those you\u2019ve lost. But you deserve to process your grief and heal.<\/p>\n<h2>Healing<\/h2>\n<p>When we are embedded deep within our grief, moving on seems impossible. It feels like it takes over our whole lives, and in some cases, it can. But eventually, somewhere down the road, you will begin to feel lighter, more like yourself, and better able to remember your lost loved one with smiles rather than tears. In many cultures we continue to grieve, but the form changes by celebrating the loved ones we lost every year. This time that you set aside to think about someone is a way to remember them without overwhelming sadness.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone&#8217;s timeline and process for feeling grief is different, and there\u2019s no right or wrong about it. However long it takes you to process your grief is the right way for you. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/6-ways-to-practice-self-compassion\/\">Be gentle with yourself<\/a>. Beating yourself up about how long your grief is lasting will only make you feel worse\u2026 and it won\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re still grieving. If you feel that you are experiencing a mental health issue that is more than grief, consider <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/\">taking a mental health test.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we lose someone we love, we can feel a whirlwind of emotions that makes our heads spin.
