If you\u2019ve never gone to therapy before, it might seem scary or uncomfortable. If you <em>have<\/em> seen a therapist, but you had a bad experience, that can be even worse! Even if you normally enjoy therapy, there might be some days when you\u2019re just not feeling it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s okay to not want to go to therapy. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to improve your experience\u2014and lots of other ways to improve your mental health outside of therapy.<\/p>\n<h2>Helping yourself outside of therapy<\/h2>\n<p>Therapy is a great way to improve your mental health\u2014but it isn\u2019t the only way. Try some of these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep a journal. <\/strong>Writing down how you feel can help you make sense of what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a little like giving therapy to yourself! Write when you feel bad <em>and <\/em>when you feel good. The next time you feel hopeless, you can look back on your journal and remember the good times.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Track your moods. <\/strong>If keeping a journal seems like too much, start small. Once a day, just write down how you feel. It\u2019ll get you in the habit of paying attention to your feelings, and you might start to see some patterns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get up and move around.<\/strong> Exercise is a great natural way to boost your mood. You can run, hike, join a sports team, or just go for a walk\u2014do something you\u2019ll enjoy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eat something.<\/strong> Your mood and your appetite are connected. If you haven\u2019t been eating, getting something in your stomach can really help. If you\u2019ve only been eating junk food, try grabbing a piece of fruit instead.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Take a break.<\/strong> Take a nap, watch your favorite TV show, or read a book. Being stressed out and overworked can do a number on your mental health.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Talk to someone.<\/strong> A friend, a family member\u2026 <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/who-can-i-talk-to-about-my-mental-health\/\">anyone you trust<\/a>. If you can\u2019t think of anyone,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/need-talk-someone-warmlines\/\">try a warmline<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/connect\/\">look for an online community<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Try the self-help resources on this site. <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/diy-tools\/\">Our list of DIY resources includes apps and worksheets<\/a> you can try on your own\u2014no therapist required.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Improving your therapy experience<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re thinking of going to therapy for the first time or giving it another chance, there are a few things you can do to improve your experience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-should-i-look-therapist\/\">Remember that every therapist is different<\/a>. Even a really good therapist might not be a good fit for you. If you\u2019ve had a bad experience with a therapist in the past, try to find someone with a different style. Read online reviews or ask a friend or family member.<\/p>\n<p>You might also be in a different place emotionally than you were the last time your saw a therapist. If it\u2019s been a while since your last experience, maybe you just weren\u2019t ready for it\u2014and maybe you are now.<\/p>\n<p>When you <em>do<\/em> go to therapy, tell your therapist why you don\u2019t want to be there. You won\u2019t be the first person they\u2019ve worked with who feels that way. Therapists are generally willing to meet you where you\u2019re at.<\/p>\n<p>If traditional therapy is just too inconvenient, you can also try to <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-does-online-therapy-work\/\">find someone who can meet with you online<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We get it\u2014therapy doesn\u2019t always sound like the most fun way to spend your time.
