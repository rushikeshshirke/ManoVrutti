Many people experience <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/what-is-depression\/\">symptoms of depression <\/a>during or after pregnancy.

The symptoms and treatment are similar no matter who is experiencing it.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);\" title=\"Depression in Fathers\" src=\"https:\/\/www.podbean.com\/player-v2\/?i=ye3sq-10707b8-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=&amp;btn-skin=7\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>What does postpartum depression feel like?<\/h2>\n<p>The symptoms of PPD are similar to other types of depression:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling or appearing low, empty inside, or irritable most of the day every day<\/li>\n<li>Losing interest in activities you would normally enjoy<\/li>\n<li>Changes in appetite\u2014eating more or less than usual<\/li>\n<li>Changes in sleep\u2014either not being able to sleep (even if the baby is asleep) or sleeping too much<\/li>\n<li>Changes in activity\u2014feeling restless or sluggish<\/li>\n<li>Feeling exhausted even when you seem to be getting enough sleep<\/li>\n<li>Speaking or moving slowly, fidgeting, or pacing<\/li>\n<li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions<\/li>\n<li>Thoughts of death or suicide<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, you may experience:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not feeling bonded to or interested in the baby<\/li>\n<li>Feeling anxious about the baby<\/li>\n<li>Doubting your ability to take care of the baby<\/li>\n<li>Thoughts about harming or abandoning the baby<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These thoughts and feelings can feel very uncomfortable or shocking, and depression is exacerbated by unmet expectations about what having a baby was &#8220;supposed&#8221; to feel like. Many people experience symptoms of depression during and after pregnancy. It\u2019s understandable\u2014think about it: You\u2019ve just gone through a lot of hormonal changes. Your body has changed\u2014in some ways, permanently. You\u2019re now responsible for the 24\/7 care of a helpless human being. You&#8217;re definitely not sleeping and you had no way of anticipating how all of these new experiences were going to affect your thoughts, your sense of self, and your ability to be a parent.<\/p>\n<p>While most people experience the \u201cbaby blues\u201d for a couple weeks after giving birth, PPD is different. PPD lasts longer and is more severe and many of the thoughts and experiences are a concern because you might feel scared about them or you can see how they&#8217;re seriously impacting your life.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure whether what you\u2019re experiencing is PPD, it\u2019s a good idea to ask your doctor about it. You can also take our <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/screening-tools\/postpartum-depression\/\">free online postpartum depression test<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How do you treat postpartum depression?<\/h2>\n<p>The treatment for PPD is similar to the <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/how-do-you-treat-depression\/\">treatment for other forms of depression<\/a>. Therapy is a great way of treating PPD. You can also try making lifestyle changes, such as keeping good sleep habits and taking time for yourself to relax. Reach out to friends and family for help.<\/p>\n<p>Medications can also help. However, some antidepressants should not be taken while pregnant or breastfeeding. Make sure to go over the risks and benefits of medication with your doctor.<\/p>\n<p>Treating PPD is similar to treating other types of depression\u2014but there is one new treatment specifically for PPD. Zulresso is a medication that is given at a specialized facility. The medication is injected into the patient over the course of a few days. <a href=\"https:\/\/screening.mhanational.org\/content\/locator-tool-new-postpartum-depression-treatment\/\">Click here to search for facilities that administer Zulresso<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re experiencing suicidal thoughts, you can reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting <a href=\"tel:+1-988\">988<\/a> or using the chat box at <a href=\"http:\/\/988lifeline.org\/chat\">988lifeline.org\/chat<\/a>.
